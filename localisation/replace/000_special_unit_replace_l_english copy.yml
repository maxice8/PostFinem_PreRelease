 GALLEASS_DESC:0 "Viking longboats are masterpieces of maritime design, built for speed, flexibility, and durability. Their shallow-draft hulls allow for both open sea voyages and river navigation. Constructed using the clinker technique, where overlapping planks are riveted together, they combine strength with flexibility. A symmetrical bow and stern enable swift changes in direction. The long, narrow design, powered by both oars and a single square sail, ensures rapid movement. These features make the longboats highly efficient for raiding, trading, and exploration, cementing the Vikings' reputation as formidable seafarers."
