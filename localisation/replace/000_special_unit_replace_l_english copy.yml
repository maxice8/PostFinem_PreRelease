 GALLEASS_DESC:0 "Viking longboats are masterpieces of maritime design, built for speed, flexibility, and durability. Their shallow-draft hulls allow for both open sea voyages and river navigation. Constructed using the clinker technique, where overlapping planks are riveted together, they combine strength with flexibility. A symmetrical bow and stern enable swift changes in direction. The long, narrow design, powered by both oars and a single square sail, ensures rapid movement. These features make the longboats highly efficient for raiding, trading, and exploration, cementing the Vikings' reputation as formidable seafarers."

 MAN_OF_WAR_DESC:0 "Revamped quinqueremes sail the Mediterranean, seamlessly merging ancient design with contemporary advancements. Constructed with superior timber for added resilience, its structure incorporates the age's metallurgical improvements. The ship's sails, inspired by the lateen design, optimize wind navigation, while onboard, rudimentary astrolabes enhance navigational precision. This modernized quinquereme, while reminiscent of its classical predecessor, stands out as a testament to the era's ability to harmonize the old with the new, making it a distinguished presence in the shallow Mediterranean waters."

 MUSKETEER_DESC:0 "The Gaisatai were ancient warriors, feared across all of Gaul for their might and power. They wore nothing, decorated their faces with paint and symbols, and attacked with spears and javelins. In the age following the fall of Carthage, many local Touta took up these soldiers and dressed them in heavy armor or gave them great shields, but now, as the age of gunpowder dawns, these men discard their heavy armor for lighter clothes, as they carry their mighty arquebuses into battle. These new Gaisatai are as the ancient warriors were - light infantry that strike fear into the hearts of the enemies of Gaul."
