 dutch_republic.6.db:0 "Although still maintaining a hold on the position of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and the rule over [Root.GetName], the influence of the [Root.GetMonarchistsOrFallbackName] has fallen slightly in recent times. Nobles who sought power by aligning themselves with the family are increasingly coming to view this as a sign that the House of [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName], despite its legacy, is still at the mercy of the bureaucracy and political environment of the republic.\n\nSome of those who have formed the backbone of our armed forces are requesting that [Root.Monarch.GetName] commits to asserting power more clearly in military matters. None of their suggestions contribute to very constructive purposes, but may impress the old guard."
 dutch_republic.7.db:0 "Despite the monopoly the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family holds on the office of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], [Root.GetName] has seen a current of republican ideals recently. [Root.GetStatistsOrFallbackName] have viewed this as a sign that our nation may very well be on its way towards their goal of a full-fledged republic, with some even going as far as praising the Prince of [Root.GetName] for permitting this shift. Regardless of how much truth there is to this, our recent political maneuvering keeps the dream of the [Root.GovernmentName] alive."
 dutch_republic.8.db:0 "The [Root.GetMonarchistsOrFallbackName] already wield great influence over the [Root.GetAdjective] rule, and the latest developments in the political arena have only served to strengthen their grip on our state. Some of our previously loyal subjects have taken this as a sign that the priorities of [Root.GetName] have shifted and that a time is coming when tax money will be wasted on vain pursuits of noble families. Down this road, they claim, lie only petty wars and tyranny. In protest, many people are refusing to pay taxes to support this government."
 dutch_republic.10.db:0 "The Princes of [Root.GetName] command almost unquestioned loyalty. Free elections seem to be a thing of the past, despite our nation featuring concepts akin to a republic. The [Root.GetStatistsOrFallbackName] are no longer the only ones who question the integrity of republican institutions in [Root.GetName]; rather, it's growing increasingly uncommon to refer to these concepts at all. However noble the goals of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], the underpinnings of our government form are slipping away."
 dutch_republic.13.db:0 "[Root.GetName] may be a federal union, but we still maintain enough power through blood for marriage ties to be a factor in our relationship with other nations. Even so, the more fluid the rulership, the less tangible these ties become.\n\nNations who are normally pleased with the [Root.GetStatistOrFallbackAdjective] administration now worry about the prospect that their ties to the [Root.GetAdjective] powers may be weakening as the nation leaves its hereditary traditions behind. They want to make sure influential families retain some power... including the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family."
 dutch_republic.14.db:2 "The [Root.GetStatistOrFallbackAdjective] rulers have succeeded in making institutions of [Root.GetName] increasingly representative, but one institution that has resisted recent changes is the army. One of our generals belongs to a family of nobles who have strong ties to [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s House and has been sabotaging our efforts to oust [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s loyalists from high-ranking military positions.\n\nNow, he's gone even further and wants one of his relatives, also a [Root.GetMonarchistOrFallbackAdjective], to act as advisor to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. While this young person seems like a talented commandant, we would loathe giving them influence."
 dutch_republic.16.d:0 "The [Root.GetStatistOrFallbackAdjective] rule has strengthened recently, which we can only interpret as a sign that the republic is the future. The successes of [Root.GetName], the increased trade economy and qualified administration, could only have happened to a federation of provinces like ours.\n\nBy giving up some of the dictatorial control the kings of old insisted on, we have achieved things that would have been impossible for them. Now is the time to show our confidence in these ideas by relinquishing some of our control in favor of freedom."
 dutch_republic.17.db:0 "The recent increase in support for the [Root.GetMonarchistsOrFallbackName] faction has sparked a discussion about how our [Root.GovernmentName] is viewed by other nations. A country with a weak monarch may be regarded as easy prey and unworthy of respect. What does this mean for a country lacking a monarch altogether?\n\nThe [Root.GetMonarchistsOrFallbackName] claim to have the answer. For our nation to be a contender on the international arena, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] must show [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] ability to unite and rule. Vain power displays are normally considered a waste, but perhaps one would be necessary now."
 dutch_republic.18.db:0 "The victory of the opposition in the latest struggles between [Root.GetStatistOrFallbackAdjective] and [Root.GetMonarchistsOrFallbackName] interests has turned out to unexpectedly benefit [Root.GetName]. Nobles who had taken modest interest in military matters before are now hoping for a future where a Prince of [Root.GetName] can lead our people to glory. They see a bright and proud future for the [Root.GetAdjective] republic, and whether or not they are right, this will benefit our military with much-needed leadership."
 dutch_republic.19.db:0 "Federal rule is frequently about compromise, finding a middle ground so a decision can be made. Sometimes, it isn't. In the last conflict between [Root.GetMonarchistsOrFallbackName] and [Root.GetStatistOrFallbackAdjective] interests, when the administration came out victorious, some nobles saw this as a sign that the republican rulers have grown unreasonable and presumptuous.\n\nMorale among the soldiers in our nation may remain high, but some generals are losing faith in the [Root.GetAdjective] cause. Wrong as they might be, our military strength will suffer from their lacking leadership."
 dutch_republic.20.da:1 "[Root.Mil_Advisor.GetName] is a person of action. That is why [Root.Mil_Advisor.GetSheHe] was employed by the administration and how [Root.Mil_Advisor.GetSheHe] has continued to hold the position as [Root.GetName]'s chief military advisor despite being a well-known supporter of the Orangist cause. Now, [Root.Mil_Advisor.GetHerHis] actions have turned against us.\n\nClaiming that the unquestioned strength of the [Root.GetStatistsOrFallbackName] is ruining [Root.GetName], [Root.Mil_Advisor.GetName] has rallied others who find their power threatened by the ruling faction behind [Root.Mil_Advisor.GetHerHim] and is attempting to stage a coup and take power. Now it is up to us to take action or to let this happen."

 dutch_republic.22.d:0 "Throughout the ages, war has often been the time when the rule of the many gave way to the rule of the few. Being aware of this, we are reluctant to make too many concessions in power to the military even now that our nation goes to battle.\n\nA general who has been crucial in our successes so far, at least in his own version of events, is now in conflict with representatives of the [Root.GovernmentName] on the future course of action. His military expertise is beyond question, but strong-arming [Root.GetStatistsOrFallbackName] to go along with his plans would weaken their political position in [Root.GetName]."
 dutch_republic.23.db:0 "We are at war, but not just any war. Our enemy is not only one of current circumstance, but a hated rival of [Root.GetName]. At times such as this, the provinces are united against a common threat, and nobles are eager to lead them into battle. Who better to lead than the Prince of [Root.GetName]?\n\nWhile allowing the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family to rally other nobles and the common people to war would strengthen combat morale, the [Root.GetStatistOrFallbackAdjective] are not fools. They know that the effects of this unity will linger beyond the war and that Monarchists will be reluctant to let go of any power they are granted, even for the best of causes."
 dutch_republic.24.t:0 "[Root.GetStatistsOrFallbackName] Demand Return to Status Quo"
 dutch_republic.24.db:0 "The war is over, greatly aided by the efforts of the [Root.GetMonarchistsOrFallbackName], who are still enjoying popular support from these actions and retaining much of the power granted to them. [Root.GetStatistsOrFallbackName] who were willing to make concessions to the family during wartime are now demanding a return to how things were before the war. Anything less, they argue, would be tantamount to giving control over the country to whoever leads it into battle, throwing away the representative institutions the federation is so proud of."
 dutch_republic.25.d:0 "The war took its toll on [Root.GetName]. The people fought hard, and while some may feel pride in the scars our republic will carry from this struggle, more have been reminded of the brutality of warfare. The [Root.GetStatistsOrFallbackName] see a chance to seek support for their cause among those who share these sentiments, arguing that a True Republic need not go to war and has no wish to. This could alleviate concerns people have about the future, but that future would likely belong to the [Root.GetStatistsOrFallbackName]."
 dutch_republic.27.d:2 "Some in our nation's frontier provinces look across the border with pride or ambitions of conquest. Others with fear. Bordering a nation which may threaten our sovereignty has led some influential local leaders to support [Root.GetStatistOrFallbackAdjective] agendas in the [Root.GovernmentName], hoping to avoid a Prince leading the nation who may seek to expand the [Root.GetAdjective] borders and cause unnecessary conflict with our stronger neighbor."

 dutch_republic.32.d:0 "Through elaborate schemes the foreign [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] has seized control of our States General. Together with the [Root.GetMonarchistsOrFallbackName] [From.Monarch.GetSheHe] has forced through legislation severely limiting the power of our most esteemed assembly."
