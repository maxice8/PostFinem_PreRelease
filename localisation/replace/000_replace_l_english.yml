 elective_monarchy.10.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] knows that [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] time may soon come. Wishing to secure the title for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] dynasty, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has begun to seek support for selecting one of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] progeny as next in line, questioning the choice of the Confederation. The nobles have not taken kindly to this and are considering forcing the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to abdicate in favor of the heir they have already chosen for the throne."
 elective_monarchy.13.d:0 "Being of [Root.Culture.GetName] birth, [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] often visits [Root.GetName]. Not only does the province serve as a reminder to the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] of [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] past, but the people there who normally feel somewhat estranged from their [Root.Owner.GetAdjective] rulers are glad to see that the Confederation approved a monarch who speaks their language. A recent visit has considerably improved the locals' impression of the administration."
 elective_monarchy.14.d:0 "Electing monarchs from different nations allows us, to some extent, to avoid a dynasty taking control over [Root.GetName] entirely, but also causes foreign nobles to sometimes doubt our loyalty. The [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family to which our current [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] belongs has noticed that the increased support in the Confederation for [Root.Heir.GetName] of the [Root.Heir.Dynasty.GetName] dynasty. Although they hopefully understand that they can't rule our nation forever, they are beginning to ask questions about how this will affect future cooperation between us."
 elective_monarchy.14.a:0 "Assure them that the Confederation stays loyal to the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] line."
 elective_monarchy.14.c:0 "Stay neutral. The Confederation owes allegiance only to [Root.GetName]."

 elective_monarchy.15.d:0 "After a noble of the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family ascended to the [From.GetAdjective] throne, we were hoping to see a long-time rule there by our dynasty. However, the Confederation's support of another foreign heir has strained the relationship between our nations. When pressured, [From.GetName] has made it clear that the times are changing, and that they are trying to avoid another monarch from [Root.GetName]."
 elective_monarchy.16.t:0 "[From.GetAdjective] Confederation Turns to Us"
 elective_monarchy.16.d:0 "[From.GetName] has been under pressure from the [From.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] to maintain the bloodline's hold of their throne, but the Confederation has spoken against them, in our favor. [From.Heir.GetName], already having popular support in the Confederation, is now considered their primary candidate for escaping the dynasty's grip and avoiding an absolutist monarch."
 elective_monarchy.17.d:0 "Ruling in [Root.GetName] is not like ruling in other nations. Dictating the nation's goals is difficult without approval from nobles, sometimes impossible. To a foreign monarch, this may seem disappointing and frustrating, but this cornerstone of [Root.GetAdjective] politics is highly valued in its homeland and is, in fact, what [Root.Monarch.GetName] has to thank for coming into power in the first place. Embracing these ideas might make the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] seem weak internationally, but would aid in integrating better and gaining supporters in the Confederation."
