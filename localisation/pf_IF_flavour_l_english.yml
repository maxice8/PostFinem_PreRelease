pf_ritualised_diplomacy_reform: "Ritualised Diplomacy"
pf_ritualised_diplomacy_reform_desc: "War is devastating for all those involved, and as such should only be considered a last resort. Diplomacy on the other hand, is the spice that entertains the lives of dreary men. Disagreements can simply be talked out, and countless souls can be saved. We should ritualise this practice and ensure its proper function within our courts."
mechanic_enables_discounted_host_feast_yes: "Reduces the cost of §YHosting a Feast§! by §G-50.0%§!"

HEIRESS: "Heiress"

pf_citizen_volunteers_reform: "Citizen Volunteers"
pf_citizen_volunteers_reform_desc: "The people of our state are privileged in their citizenship, giving them unique access to certain rights and abilities within our jurisdiction. This service has, however, often come without a price. We should extend citizenship to a wider audience but at the cost of enlistment in our army. This will ensure a steady flow of new patriotic recruits, ready to die to earn their place in this country, even posthumously."

pf_eager_councillors_reform: "Eager Councillors"
pf_eager_councillors_reform_desc: "Our people are well aware of their rights and responsibilties as part of the Italian Federation, and wish to exercise them to their fullest extent.

pf_punic_festivals_reform: "Support Punic Festivals"
pf_punic_festivals_reform_desc: "The Punic religion has grown more informal over time, but over that transition its influence over grassroots followers has only grown. There are a great many festivals that now fill up the calendar, some nation-wide, but many restricted to just one region or even village. Every one of these events are vitally important to the spirit and continuation of our faith - the state should step in and fund them to ensure their continuation."
mechanic_ending_wars_gives_stability_yes: "Ending a war has a §Y+25.0%§! chance to give §G+1§! Stability."

italian_minor_ideas_1: "Growth of the Towns of Italia"
italian_minor_ideas_1_desc: "Italia has always been a populous place, but in recent centuries it has seen a relative population boom. In response, many states have begun a process of urbanisation in order to cope with the influx of people from the countryside."
italian_minor_ideas_2: "Encourage Innovation"
italian_minor_ideas_2_desc: "Ours is a land of potential and fairness, where no one is discouraged from their work and all discoveries are accepted."
italian_minor_ideas_3: "Courts of the Federation"
italian_minor_ideas_3_desc: "Despite making up parts of a greater whole, each of the courts of the member states of the Federation is autonomous and acts entirely to its own self-righteous principle."
italian_minor_ideas_4: "Free Trade Leagues"
italian_minor_ideas_4_desc: "Many of the smaller towns on the coasts have come together to create 'trade leagues', aimed at mutual defence and collective bargaining with the greater powers in the region. We should use these towns to further our own mercantile interests."
italian_minor_ideas_5: "Soldiers of Lesser Fortune"
italian_minor_ideas_5_desc: "Many people in Italia are used to lives in the countryside without a care in the world, and as such vehemently resist conscription. As a result, many rulers now turn to foreign mercenaries to fill the gaps in their regiments."
italian_minor_ideas_6: "Italian Naval Prowess"
italian_minor_ideas_6_desc: "Hemmed in by the great turquoise sea, Italia has always been the home of great sailors and seamen. Let us use this proud heritage to produce a fine navy of our own, with which we can rule the Mediterranean."
italian_minor_ideas_7: "A Land of Many Gods"
italian_minor_ideas_7_desc: "While Italia has seen its many faiths merge into one dominant Punic one, there are still a great many minorities present within the region. We must make sure the Jews, Christians, Hellenes, and Romans are treated carefully and respectfully."

NAP_ideas: "Neapolitan Ideas"
NAP_ideas_start: "Neapolitan Traditions"
NAP_ideas_bonus: "Neapolitan Ambition"

nap_lady_of_naples: "The Lady of Naples"
nap_lady_of_naples_desc: "The succession of Iulia to the throne of Naples was a shock to everyone, but nonetheless she now stands as our formidable Lady. Under her leadership, our city will be led to new levels of glory, extending our influence across the south, investing in the flourishing arts of Italia, and patronising other remarkable woman like Iulia."
nap_princes_of_the_south: "Princes of the South"
nap_princes_of_the_south_desc: "The south of Italia has been divided into many petty counties, free cities, and bishoprics for a long time, and despite our shared identity, there are a great many differences between us. It will take a cautious and selective diplomat to ensure we preserve the peace and stability of the region while still achieving our aims."
nap_purple_dye: "Revitalisation of Tyrian Purple"
nap_purple_dye_desc: "Long ago, the colour of empire was every present in the Mediterranean - Tyrian purple. Precious and extremely hard to make, this dye was sourced from only one path of coastline in Phoenicia, but its vibrant tones proved lucrative both to those who traded in it and the kings who wore it. Naples is a rich city, like those once draped in purple in the past - let us once again adopt this colour as ours, and use it to ensure our dynastic glory."
nap_secular_clergy: "Empower the Secular Clergy"
nap_secular_clergy_desc: "The clergy are a powerful force in Italian politics, but their grip is stronger in some places than others. In some states the priests hold full control, making them practically theocracies, while in others like Naples, they are resigned to a more secular administrative role at the service of the government."
nap_castles: "Fortresses of Dreams"
nap_castles_desc: "There are a great many nobles in the south of Italia, each with their own grand ambitions and levies. Due to the constant threat of conflict and domineering politics, many have build their own castles to reside in. We can repurpose some of these estates to act solely as defensive structures, and then use them to hold off against enemy attacks on our borders."
nap_city_of_pleasure: "The City of Pleasure"
nap_city_of_pleasure_desc: "As Naples has grown, so has its place in the world. Many now flock to its streets, taking a break from their dreary lives in the solemn north, seeking solace in our taverns, delicious food, and most significantly of all, our pleasure scene. Now, our fair city is rich and vibrant with many more smells than just exotic spices and fish."
nap_mecenate: "Patron of the Arts"
nap_mecenate_desc: "In the tradition of wealthy Italian nobles, our rulers have made sure to consistently support the burgeoning arts movement in the region, showing off both their riches and their culture. A great many artists rely on the patronage of our lords and ladies, and produce the finest works known to man for our sole use."

iffc_guilds: "Strengthen the Guilds"
iffc_guilds_desc: "The merchant guilds are the backbone of our economy, managing trade and production within our walls and with other cities. If we wish to flourish, we must give the guilds free reign to act in their best interests, as after all, their best interests are also our best interests."
iffc_bankers: "Italian Banking Families"
iffc_bankers_desc: "There are many great banking families in Italia, vast hoard of generational wealth that have fueled the treasuries of kings and counts for centuries. We too should take advantage of this pool of money when needed."
iffc_civitas: "Defence of the Civitas"
iffc_civitas_desc: "The rights afforded to a citizen come at a price - every man can be conscripted in times of war and called up to defend his city. Because it is their homes they are fighting for, these men will be more than willing to die for our cause."
iffc_ballroom_dancing: "Festivals and Balls"
iffc_ballroom_dancing_desc: "One show of wealth is gold and jewels, but a more practical one is great parties and events. Let us use our government buildings to host such occassions and invite dignitaries from across the city and the whole Federation."
iffc_banishment: "Criminal Law Code"
iffc_banishment_desc: "Every city needs a law code, else its streets would descend into chaos. In addition to the establishment of a formal Patrol to keep the peace, we must define what is and isn't a crime and how it should be punished."

cln_patronage_of_astarte: "Patronage of Astarte"
cln_patronage_of_astarte_desc: "Inspired by a vision he had as a child, Conan devoted his life to the service of the goddess Astarte. In every city he conquered he erected a temple to her, and in his dreams he asked her for advice for his next move."
cln_mahedi: "The Mahedi"

cln_insurance_tax: "Insurance Tax"
cln_insurance_tax_desc: "The martial success of Conan and his warriors was known to all. The leaders of neighbouring cities and states would pay an 'insurance tax' to the adventurer king in order to disuade him from attacking them."
cln_rule_by_the_sword: "Rule by the Sword"

ITY_ideas: "Italian Ideas"
ITY_ideas_start: "Italian Traditions"
ITY_ideas_bonus: "Italian Ambition"

ity_roman_rites: "Roman Rites"
ity_roman_rites_desc: "Our country has become a bastion of the old ways of the Italians. Those who rejected the influence of the Punic menace on our gods were ostracised from society, and forced into relative exile in the once sparse Po Valley. Over time, our lands have become just as urbanised and in many cases more so than the lands from which our people fled. Every year, more and more children are educated into the Romana faith, while the grip of the Punic ways in the north slips further and further. We will never surrender!"
ity_po_valley: "The Garden of Italia"
ity_po_valley_desc: "The Po is the lifeblood of northern Italia, bringing fresh water down from the Alps and fertilising all the lands we depend on. The fields it touched are like those licked by the gods themselves, abundant in animal and plant life, and fostering a positively paradisal environment for humans."
ity_sappers: "Reform the Engineering Corps"
ity_sappers_desc: "Much like the other armies of the Federation, our regiments have been made up of irregular volunteers for centuries, only coming to the muster at times of dire need. While other states move towards having permanent standing armies of infantry, our strategists have opted for a more dangerous but potentially lucrative way - investment in the engineering corps. Despite our lack of numbers and skill in fighting, our troops will be able to build defenses no matter the terrain, and our sappers and cannoneers will be able to take down any wall."
ity_university_cities: "University Cities"
ity_university_cities_desc: "A burgeoning scientific movement is sprouting in Italia, sparked by the rising wealth of the burghers across the region. Their sons yearn for more knowledge, and find great disatisfaction in the state's lack of provision in that field. As such, we should sponsor the creation of universities in our largest cities, ensuring the burghers stay happy and our country remains on the forefront of technological innovation."
ity_grand_temple_of_mars: "Great Temple of Mars"
ity_grand_temple_of_mars_desc: "Mars was once a virtuous god of war for the peoples of Italia, until the vile Punicians twisted him into a monster. We must reclaim his image and elevate his position to that of supremacy within our country. Only the best patronage will do - nothing short of a great temple erected in his name in our capital would satisfy him."
ity_court_of_the_north: "Court of the North"
ity_court_of_the_north_desc: "The many other states of the Federation are small, most encompassing but one city. Ours on the other hand is a kingdom on its own, encompassing hundreds of settlements and wielding extraordinary power compared to our neighbours. Controlling all these disparate areas is quite a difficult task, and as a result our country has adopted a policy of recruiting courtiers from the provinces, ensuring every man can look to the palace and see a familiar face there."
ity_the_rebel_prince: "The Rebel Prince"
ity_the_rebel_prince_desc: "Our adherence to the Romana faith greatly annoys the Grand Adirim in Roma, and not a day goes by when he doesn't demand our complete subordination. While lesser states would cave before his demands, ours stands proudly defiant. Rebel has long been used as a slur against the common man; sometimes, rebellion is the only righteous thing to do."

SZO_ideas: "Saluzzo Ideas"
SZO_ideas_start: "Saluzzo Traditions"
SZO_ideas_bonus: "Saluzzo Ambitions"

szo_castle_on_the_hill: "Castle on the Hill"
szo_castle_on_the_hill_desc: "Our order had no choice but to flee up the slopes of the Alps - ours is not a voluntary exile. But nontheless, we have made a home for ourselves up here. With the consent and cooperation of the local farmers, what was once a small commune has grown to become a mighty fortress on the side of a mountain, providing shelter for so-called 'rebels' and disaffected citizens of the lowlands of all kinds. Behind our walls, we are safe from whatever twisted form of justice the Federation's princes wish to enact on us."
szo_iron_mines: "Heart of Iron"
szo_iron_mines_desc: "While the people of the region we now inhabit originally made their money through herding and selling their livestock, a far more lucrative deal has been won for them. During the excavations for our great fortress, a vast deposit of high quality iron ore was discovered within the belly of the surrounding mountains. With support from the treasury of the Order, the people who live in the fields around us now find much more wealth in mining and smelting this ore, which not only provides the area with a stronger income stream, but also demands that those who rely on our exports take any attack against us much more seriously."
szo_master_manipulators: "Master Manipulators"
szo_master_manipulators_desc: "Some would term our negotiators and leaders as 'gaslighters' or 'liars', but these terms are entirely incorrect and used only to slander us. What is true however is that members of the Order have a knack at getting their own ways, using a variety of verbal and physical tactics to ensure the best outcomes for them and the organisation as a whole. Even in the most dire of circumstances, we can claw back much of the damage and soon get relations back to normal."
szo_the_spies: "Men of Mischief"
szo_the_spies_desc: "We are like the shadows on your walls, passing through the candle-lit halls unseen and without a sound. We can sneak through even the creakiest of doors, and tread around the most aggressive of dogs. No one ever sees us coming. One moment, you are happy, enjoying life with your wife and children, dreaming of the dinner you hope the evening will bring, and the next, you are lying face down in a ditch with an arrow in your back. No one escapes us. When a job needs doing, we will perform it."
szo_safeguard_the_alpine_passes: "Safeguard the Alpine Passes"
szo_safeguard_the_alpine_passes_desc: "The Order has a fondness for justice, and will only do tasks it considers righteous or particularly profitable. The trade routes over the Alps are dangerous, often plagued by highwaymen and gangsters, severely impacting both the amount of goods that can enter Italia from the north and the confidence merchants have in using those roads. The attacks these people suffer are completely barbaric and totally unjustified, and since many of the common routes extend around our territory, it would be amiss of us not to use our forces and expertise to provide whatever protection we can to these blameless traders."
szo_the_codex: "The Codex of Artismer"
szo_the_codex_desc: "One of the original founding members of the Order, a noble man named Artismer, was the first to suggest a set of formal written 'laws' should be compiled for use within our communes. The resulting document is known as the Codex of Artismer after him, and gives suggestions on the proper behaviour of members and illustrates potential punishments for listed crimes in gruesome detail. Every child born within our convent is taught these rules from the earliest age, and hence many of our agents have grown up with them baked into their very souls. These rulers will provide stability to the Order for years to come."
szo_let_the_people_rise: "Thus Always to Tyrants"
szo_let_the_people_rise_desc: "We are not fond of tyrannical rulers, be they monarchs, priests, or so-called representatives of the people. Many in our ranks have had their own experiences within the dungeons of these god-ordained kings, and as such have a strong hate for any such institution. Where ever there are downtrodden people in the world, if we can help them to get back on their feet and strike back at their former masters, we will do so."

ILY_ideas_bonus: "Illyrian Ambition"

ily_the_marcher_lord: "The Marcher King"
ily_the_marcher_lord_desc: "Illyria is a kingdom on the frontiers of the Federation, the only bulwark against the Germanic tribes and the threatening Macedonian empire. Through the strength of our arms, the perseverance of our people, and the effectiveness of our diplomacy, we will come out triumphant and hold against all enemies, and, like the great walls of the ancients, we will still stand to guard these lands in a thousand years."
ily_arm_the_serfs: "Arming the Serfs"
ily_arm_the_serfs_desc: "Unlike the more urbanised and wealthy states of the Federation, we do not have the luxury of being able to hire trained professional troops and mercenaries. Apart from the core section of mounted aristocrats, the rest of our armies are made up of irregular commonfolk pressed into service. Let us scour the beaches and hillsides for every man available, and send him off to war!"
ily_adriatic_trade_fleets: "Adriatic Ordinances"
ily_adriatic_trade_fleets_desc: "The Adriatic Sea is a lucrative place for trade, hosting the sea route to the Aegean and our direct connenctions with Italia. It is also a hotly contested area, full of competing merchants and rampant piracy. We should introduce a new set of policies to combat these problems and sure Illyrian interests come out on top in the region."
ily_illyrian_pride: "Illyrian Pride"
ily_illyrian_pride_desc: "In the past, we were a thousand different peoples with a thousand different traditions and a thousand difference tongues. Now, we are one, united under our glorious flag, and ready to stand side by side until our dying moments. The patriotism of an Illyrian is obvious from the most lowly alewife to the servants of the king himself."
ily_renaissance: "Patronising New Ideas"
ily_renaissance_desc: "A new era is dawning across the world - an era of free thinking and science. While our country has been a bastion of tradition and aristocracy for many centuries, there is no reason why these two ideas should compete. Let us patronise these new ways of thinking and incorporate their technologies into our governance, keeping the hand of the monarch steady and the rule of the great barons enshrined."
ily_delegated_power: "The Iron Rule"
ily_delegated_power_desc: "There are many nobles who rule vast estates in the hills and mountains, far from any source of real state power. We can do little but trust in their allegiance to us, creating a situation that leaves the realm open to internal rebellion and strife. Introduce a new Iron Rule, a code of conduct regarding the powerful aristocrats - so long as they continue to provide levies and taxes, we will not overstep onto their estates, and will respect their autonomy."
ily_musket_bearers: "Snoop and Shoot"
ily_musket_bearers_desc: "The difficult terrain of the Balkans peninsular has led to a new style of battle emerging. Since there is little room and even fewer opportunities for an open pitched battle in the style of those in Western Europe, our generals pick their locations carefully, using the cover provided by the terrain to their fullest advantage. Our musketeers hide behind trees and rocks, peek out to meet their targets, shoot, and then disappear once more into the environment. Armies unused to this irregular style will surely be taken by surprise and fall into panic rather quickly."

Two of the realm's foremost aristocrats, [Root.noble_1.GetName] and [Root.noble_2.GetName], known for being long time friends, began a debate over whether Romans or Carthaginians ought to have won the Second Punic War.

Even the cooks are complaining they are being overworked in our attempts to accomodate this man, and the waiters are growing tired of marching back and forth from his table.

pf_feast.6.t: "The Game of Old Ur"
pf_feast.6.d: "Since time immemorial, the Royal Game of Ur has been played upon the tables of kings, peasants, and all in between. Consisting of pieces which must be moved across a grid of squares safely, this game is reminiscent of many other classics, but for some odd reason, it has stuck around the longest. One of the more boisterous and ambitious nobles at the feast has challenged you, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], to a game - the gall!

Wine goblets chimed, and laughter filled the hall as guests shared stories, songs, and jests. Bards in a corner of the hall struck up a lively tune, and couples began to dance, their colorful garments swirling like autumn leaves in a gentle breeze.\n\nThe last strains of music faded into the night, and the grand feast came to an end. The hall, now hushed and dimly lit, bore witness to the aftermath of the revelry. Empty goblets and half-filled platters remained, silent remnants of a celebration that would be remembered for years to come.

When the Brigantes seized control over much of the north of Albion, his family was driven out into exile in the Brittonic Confederation in the south. There, the young man met Guinevere, a beautiful and capable princess of the Iceni, and discovered the love of his life. One night, while recovering from a terrible fever, he was visited in a dream by the eastern goddess Astarte, who commanded him to take up arms and reconquer Phoenicia for her true believers. Despite the unusual nature of his vision, he gathered a strong following and departed from the shores of Albion with his men in spring 1442. In the following year, they battled pirates and fierce storms, before finally making permanent landfall in Sicily. The band fought with the local king and seized nearly half the island, believing it would make a useful base of operations for their further campaigns. Now, Conan stands at a crossroads. His goddess still calls to him, like a siren ushering him closer to Phoenicia. But their travels have been years already, and many in his entourage are tired and wish to settle down in the rich lands they have just recently conquered. Yet Conan is still the master of his own fate - the world will bend and twist at his whim."

With fire and sword, they pillaged the village, leaving a trail of destruction in their wake.\n\nAmidst the smoke and chaos, a lone knight of Illyria arrived on horseback, his armor glistening in the setting sun. Sir Agron, renowned for his chivalry and honor, had heard of the village's plight and vowed to defend its people. With unwavering courage, Sir Agron confronted the marauders, his sword flashing like a comet. His shield bore the emblem of a white stag, symbolizing the purity of his cause. He fought valiantly, disarming foes and rallying the villagers to resist. Sonhavn's brave men and women, inspired by the knight's noble example, took up makeshift weapons and stood alongside him.\n\nThe battle raged from dawn until dusk, but the marauders, disheartened by the villagers' newfound resolve and Sir Agron's unwavering valor, were driven back. The knight's unwavering commitment to chivalry and the defense of the innocent had saved Sonhavn from ruin. As the moon rose that night, the villagers gathered around a bonfire to celebrate their victory and express their gratitude to Sir Agron. They offered him their finest foods and told tales of his gallant deeds that would be sung for generations to come.\n\nWith a humble smile, Sir Agron declined their offerings, stating that it was his duty as a knight to protect those in need.

pf_feast.26.a: "I apologise for this, but we might have to drink water instead."

pf_feast.26.c: "Let us try some of the local delicacy, [Root.GetAdjective] Red."

pf_feast.27.d: "In a great test of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] tenacity and intellect, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has engaged with one of the guests at the feast, arguing over various philosophical ideas in such depth that most ordinary men would have fainted long ago. What is sure however, is that both parties will leave this debate enriched and fulfilled, their brains suitably exercised."

pf_feast.30.b: "He can play for the commonfolk of [Root.GetName] instead."

pf_feast.31.t: "Laughing with my Pals"
pf_feast.31.d: "The jester we hired for the feast has proven to be a hit with all our guests. After a long night of jokes and sons, all of our stomachs' were hurting from too much laughter."
pf_feast.31.a: "Hahaha!"

pf_feast.32.t: "Jester Mocks the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
pf_feast.32.d: "The jester we hired for the feast was doing great, but then he made a rather dicey joke about the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. The room fell silent, with all our guests waiting to see the reaction of the monarch to what was clearly an insulting jab that had gone way too far."
pf_feast.32.a: "Umm maybe we should go to another room."

pf_feast.32.c: "Hahaha! That was so funny."

pf_feast.33.t: "Too Drunk"
pf_feast.33.d: "All of us have drunk so much wine, we now mope around uncontrolled throughout the halls and libraries. Whatever spirit of fun and activity we had before the drink is long gone by this point."
pf_feast.33.a: "Ugh this is going to be an awful hangover..."
pf_feast.33.b: "Get everyone a bowl of water! We will work through this."
