pf_ritualised_diplomacy_reform: "Ritualised Diplomacy"
pf_ritualised_diplomacy_reform_desc: "War is devastating for all those involved, and as such should only be considered a last resort. Diplomacy on the other hand, is the spice that entertains the lives of dreary men. Disagreements can simply be talked out, and countless souls can be saved. We should ritualise this practice and ensure its proper function within our courts."
mechanic_enables_discounted_host_feast_yes: "Reduces the cost of §YHosting a Feast§! by §G-50.0%§!"

neapolitan_principality_reform: "Neapolitan Principality"
neapolitan_principality_reform_desc: "Naples is a powerful city at the center of a collection of territories. While its ruler remains humble, titling themselves as only the Lord or Lady of Naples, the extent of our indirect rule across Southern Italy is known to all."
PRINCE: "Prince"
HEIRESS: "Heiress"

pf_citizen_volunteers_reform: "Citizen Volunteers"
pf_citizen_volunteers_reform_desc: "The people of our state are privileged in their citizenship, giving them unique access to certain rights and abilities within our jurisdiction. This service has, however, often come without a price. We should extend citizenship to a wider audience but at the cost of enlistment in our army. This will ensure a steady flow of new patriotic recruits, ready to die to earn their place in this country, even posthumously."

pf_eager_councillors_reform: "Eager Councillors"
pf_eager_councillors_reform_desc: "Our people are well aware of their rights and responsibilties as part of the Italian Federation, and wish to exercise them to their fullest extent. With faith in their hearts and exciting ideas in their heads, our emassaries will ensure our country's voice is heard in the Council of the Federation."
mechanic_more_reasons_for_petition_acceptance_yes: "The §YGrand Adirim§! will have §G+30§! reasons to accept our §YPetitions§!."

pf_punic_festivals_reform: "Support Punic Festivals"
pf_punic_festivals_reform_desc: "The Punic religion has grown more informal over time, but over that transition its influence over grassroots followers has only grown. There are a great many festivals that now fill up the calendar, some nation-wide, but many restricted to just one region or even village. Every one of these events are vitally important to the spirit and continuation of our faith - the state should step in and fund them to ensure their continuation."
mechanic_ending_wars_gives_stability_yes: "Ending a war has a §Y+25.0%§! chance to give §G+1§! Stability."

astartean_adventurer_reform: "Adventurers of Astarte"
astartean_adventurer_reform_desc: "The goddess Astarte came to Conan and commanded him to launch a holy war to reclaim Phoenicia, leading him and his followers on a years-long adventure from the shores of windy Albion towards the Purple Cities."

order_of_the_shadows_reform: "Order of the Shadows"
order_of_the_shadows_reform_desc: "The Order is made up of like-minded freedom fighters and rebels without a home, living in isolation away from the reaches of tyrannical governments. Every member subscribes to the Codex and adheres to the strict commands of the Grandmaster."

italian_minor_ideas_1: "Growth of the Towns of Italia"
italian_minor_ideas_1_desc: "Italia has always been a populous place, but in recent centuries it has seen a relative population boom. In response, many states have begun a process of urbanisation in order to cope with the influx of people from the countryside."
italian_minor_ideas_2: "Encourage Innovation"
italian_minor_ideas_2_desc: "Ours is a land of potential and fairness, where no one is discouraged from their work and all discoveries are accepted."
italian_minor_ideas_3: "Courts of the Federation"
italian_minor_ideas_3_desc: "Despite making up parts of a greater whole, each of the courts of the member states of the Federation is autonomous and acts entirely to its own self-righteous principle."
italian_minor_ideas_4: "Free Trade Leagues"
italian_minor_ideas_4_desc: "Many of the smaller towns on the coasts have come together to create 'trade leagues', aimed at mutual defence and collective bargaining with the greater powers in the region. We should use these towns to further our own mercantile interests."
italian_minor_ideas_5: "Soldiers of Lesser Fortune"
italian_minor_ideas_5_desc: "Many people in Italia are used to lives in the countryside without a care in the world, and as such vehemently resist conscription. As a result, many rulers now turn to foreign mercenaries to fill the gaps in their regiments."
italian_minor_ideas_6: "Italian Naval Prowess"
italian_minor_ideas_6_desc: "Hemmed in by the great turquoise sea, Italia has always been the home of great sailors and seamen. Let us use this proud heritage to produce a fine navy of our own, with which we can rule the Mediterranean."
italian_minor_ideas_7: "A Land of Many Gods"
italian_minor_ideas_7_desc: "While Italia has seen its many faiths merge into one dominant Punic one, there are still a great many minorities present within the region. We must make sure the Jews, Christians, Hellenes, and Romans are treated carefully and respectfully."

NAP_ideas: "Neapolitan Ideas"
NAP_ideas_start: "Neapolitan Traditions"
NAP_ideas_bonus: "Neapolitan Ambition"

nap_lady_of_naples: "The Lady of Naples"
nap_lady_of_naples_desc: "The succession of Iulia to the throne of Naples was a shock to everyone, but nonetheless she now stands as our formidable Lady. Under her leadership, our city will be led to new levels of glory, extending our influence across the south, investing in the flourishing arts of Italia, and patronising other remarkable woman like Iulia."
nap_princes_of_the_south: "Princes of the South"
nap_princes_of_the_south_desc: "The south of Italia has been divided into many petty counties, free cities, and bishoprics for a long time, and despite our shared identity, there are a great many differences between us. It will take a cautious and selective diplomat to ensure we preserve the peace and stability of the region while still achieving our aims."
nap_purple_dye: "Revitalisation of Tyrian Purple"
nap_purple_dye_desc: "Long ago, the colour of empire was every present in the Mediterranean - Tyrian purple. Precious and extremely hard to make, this dye was sourced from only one path of coastline in Phoenicia, but its vibrant tones proved lucrative both to those who traded in it and the kings who wore it. Naples is a rich city, like those once draped in purple in the past - let us once again adopt this colour as ours, and use it to ensure our dynastic glory."
nap_secular_clergy: "Empower the Secular Clergy"
nap_secular_clergy_desc: "The clergy are a powerful force in Italian politics, but their grip is stronger in some places than others. In some states the priests hold full control, making them practically theocracies, while in others like Naples, they are resigned to a more secular administrative role at the service of the government."
nap_castles: "Fortresses of Dreams"
nap_castles_desc: "There are a great many nobles in the south of Italia, each with their own grand ambitions and levies. Due to the constant threat of conflict and domineering politics, many have build their own castles to reside in. We can repurpose some of these estates to act solely as defensive structures, and then use them to hold off against enemy attacks on our borders."
nap_city_of_pleasure: "The City of Pleasure"
nap_city_of_pleasure_desc: "As Naples has grown, so has its place in the world. Many now flock to its streets, taking a break from their dreary lives in the solemn north, seeking solace in our taverns, delicious food, and most significantly of all, our pleasure scene. Now, our fair city is rich and vibrant with many more smells than just exotic spices and fish."
nap_mecenate: "Patron of the Arts"
nap_mecenate_desc: "In the tradition of wealthy Italian nobles, our rulers have made sure to consistently support the burgeoning arts movement in the region, showing off both their riches and their culture. A great many artists rely on the patronage of our lords and ladies, and produce the finest works known to man for our sole use."

cln_patronage_of_astarte: "Patronage of Astarte"
cln_patronage_of_astarte_desc: "Inspired by a vision he had as a child, Conan devoted his life to the service of the goddess Astarte. In every city he conquered he erected a temple to her, and in his dreams he asked her for advice for his next move."

cln_insurance_tax: "Insurance Tax"
cln_insurance_tax_desc: "The martial success of Conan and his warriors was known to all. The leaders of neighbouring cities and states would pay an 'insurance tax' to the adventurer king in order to disuade him from attacking them."
cln_rule_by_the_sword: "Rule by the Sword"
cln_rule_by_the_sword_desc: "Conan won the loyalty of his troops through his many victories in battle and his charming mannerisms. Any future leaders of our nation will have to demonstrate the same virtues, else they will face the blade of a better man."
cln_love_poems: "Heritage of Romance"
cln_love_poems_desc: "Conan and his wife Guinevere had a long and passionate love life, including several intricately composed love letters sent between each other. Let us make our court a mirror of their life, one of romance, chivalry, and fine poems."
cln_ambitions: "Qadishu-Harb"

ITY_ideas: "Italian Ideas"
ITY_ideas_start: "Italian Traditions"
ITY_ideas_bonus: "Italian Ambition"

ity_roman_rites: "Roman Rites"
ity_roman_rites_desc: "Our country has become a bastion of the old ways of the Italians. Those who rejected the influence of the Punic menace on our gods were ostracised from society, and forced into relative exile in the once sparse Po Valley. Over time, our lands have become just as urbanised and in many cases more so than the lands from which our people fled. Every year, more and more children are educated into the Romana faith, while the grip of the Punic ways in the north slips further and further. We will never surrender!"
ity_po_valley: "The Garden of Italia"
ity_po_valley_desc: "The Po is the lifeblood of northern Italia, bringing fresh water down from the Alps and fertilising all the lands we depend on. The fields it touched are like those licked by the gods themselves, abundant in animal and plant life, and fostering a positively paradisal environment for humans."
ity_sappers: "Reform the Engineering Corps"
ity_sappers_desc: "Much like the other armies of the Federation, our regiments have been made up of irregular volunteers for centuries, only coming to the muster at times of dire need. While other states move towards having permanent standing armies of infantry, our strategists have opted for a more dangerous but potentially lucrative way - investment in the engineering corps. Despite our lack of numbers and skill in fighting, our troops will be able to build defenses no matter the terrain, and our sappers and cannoneers will be able to take down any wall."
ity_university_cities: "University Cities"
ity_university_cities_desc: "A burgeoning scientific movement is sprouting in Italia, sparked by the rising wealth of the burghers across the region. Their sons yearn for more knowledge, and find great disatisfaction in the state's lack of provision in that field. As such, we should sponsor the creation of universities in our largest cities, ensuring the burghers stay happy and our country remains on the forefront of technological innovation."
ity_grand_temple_of_mars: "Great Temple of Mars"
ity_grand_temple_of_mars_desc: "Mars was once a virtuous god of war for the peoples of Italia, until the vile Punicians twisted him into a monster. We must reclaim his image and elevate his position to that of supremacy within our country. Only the best patronage will do - nothing short of a great temple erected in his name in our capital would satisfy him."
ity_court_of_the_north: "Court of the North"
ity_court_of_the_north_desc: "The many other states of the Federation are small, most encompassing but one city. Ours on the other hand is a kingdom on its own, encompassing hundreds of settlements and wielding extraordinary power compared to our neighbours. Controlling all these disparate areas is quite a difficult task, and as a result our country has adopted a policy of recruiting courtiers from the provinces, ensuring every man can look to the palace and see a familiar face there."
ity_the_rebel_prince: "The Rebel Prince"
ity_the_rebel_prince_desc: "Our adherence to the Romana faith greatly annoys the Grand Adirim in Roma, and not a day goes by when he doesn't demand our complete subordination. While lesser states would cave before his demands, ours stands proudly defiant. Rebel has long been used as a slur against the common man; sometimes, rebellion is the only righteous thing to do."

SZO_ideas: "Saluzzo Ideas"
SZO_ideas_start: "Saluzzo Traditions"
SZO_ideas_bonus: "Saluzzo Ambitions"

szo_castle_on_the_hill: "Castle on the Hill"
szo_castle_on_the_hill_desc: "Our order had no choice but to flee up the slopes of the Alps - ours is not a voluntary exile. But nontheless, we have made a home for ourselves up here. With the consent and cooperation of the local farmers, what was once a small commune has grown to become a mighty fortress on the side of a mountain, providing shelter for so-called 'rebels' and disaffected citizens of the lowlands of all kinds. Behind our walls, we are safe from whatever twisted form of justice the Federation's princes wish to enact on us."
szo_iron_mines: "Heart of Iron"
szo_iron_mines_desc: "While the people of the region we now inhabit originally made their money through herding and selling their livestock, a far more lucrative deal has been won for them. During the excavations for our great fortress, a vast deposit of high quality iron ore was discovered within the belly of the surrounding mountains. With support from the treasury of the Order, the people who live in the fields around us now find much more wealth in mining and smelting this ore, which not only provides the area with a stronger income stream, but also demands that those who rely on our exports take any attack against us much more seriously."
szo_master_manipulators: "Master Manipulators"
szo_master_manipulators_desc: "Some would term our negotiators and leaders as 'gaslighters' or 'liars', but these terms are entirely incorrect and used only to slander us. What is true however is that members of the Order have a knack at getting their own ways, using a variety of verbal and physical tactics to ensure the best outcomes for them and the organisation as a whole. Even in the most dire of circumstances, we can claw back much of the damage and soon get relations back to normal."
szo_the_spies: "Men of Mischief"
szo_the_spies_desc: "We are like the shadows on your walls, passing through the candle-lit halls unseen and without a sound. We can sneak through even the creakiest of doors, and tread around the most aggressive of dogs. No one ever sees us coming. One moment, you are happy, enjoying life with your wife and children, dreaming of the dinner you hope the evening will bring, and the next, you are lying face down in a ditch with an arrow in your back. No one escapes us. When a job needs doing, we will perform it."
szo_safeguard_the_alpine_passes: "Safeguard the Alpine Passes"
szo_safeguard_the_alpine_passes_desc: "The Order has a fondness for justice, and will only do tasks it considers righteous or particularly profitable. The trade routes over the Alps are dangerous, often plagued by highwaymen and gangsters, severely impacting both the amount of goods that can enter Italia from the north and the confidence merchants have in using those roads. The attacks these people suffer are completely barbaric and totally unjustified, and since many of the common routes extend around our territory, it would be amiss of us not to use our forces and expertise to provide whatever protection we can to these blameless traders."
szo_the_codex: "The Codex of Artismer"
szo_the_codex_desc: "One of the original founding members of the Order, a noble man named Artismer, was the first to suggest a set of formal written 'laws' should be compiled for use within our communes. The resulting document is known as the Codex of Artismer after him, and gives suggestions on the proper behaviour of members and illustrates potential punishments for listed crimes in gruesome detail. Every child born within our convent is taught these rules from the earliest age, and hence many of our agents have grown up with them baked into their very souls. These rulers will provide stability to the Order for years to come."
szo_let_the_people_rise: "Thus Always to Tyrants"
szo_let_the_people_rise_desc: "We are not fond of tyrannical rulers, be they monarchs, priests, or so-called representatives of the people. Many in our ranks have had their own experiences within the dungeons of these god-ordained kings, and as such have a strong hate for any such institution. Where ever there are downtrodden people in the world, if we can help them to get back on their feet and strike back at their former masters, we will do so."

pf_if.1.t: "Federal Dignitaries"
pf_if.1.d: "The Federation has a great many nobles and autocrats hailing from its diverse collection of cultures. These wealthy men and women demand to be entertained by only the finest courts, given the finest dinners and listen to only the finest music. As such, it is a great honour that a group of them have asked to be hosted in our capital."
pf_if.1.a: "They will bring prestige to [Root.Capital.GetName]!"

pf_if.2.t: "An Ambassador for [Root.GetName]"
pf_if.2.d: "Every state should have an official ambassador to go to the court of the Italian Federation and represent our interests. In the current moment, we are lacking such an important figure. The state department has hand-picked a selection of candidates for us to recruit from."
pf_if.2.a: "Appoint him as our state ambassador."
pf_if.2.b: "He will make a great diplomat."

pf_if.3.t: "The Growth of [growth_province.GetName]"
pf_if.3.d: "The city of [growth_province.GetName] is a growing metropolis, full of eager businessmen and investors who would gladly see the state invest in its infrastructure. Let us take care of this little town, so that one day it might be a jewel in our crown."
pf_if.3.a: "Invest in the administrative infrastructure of [growth_province.GetName]."
pf_if.3.b: "Increase the industrial capabilities of the region."

pf_if_growth_of_a_city: "Growth of a City"

pf_if.4.t: "Federal Art"
pf_if.4.d: "A new style of art is emerging in the marble palaces of Italia. Referred to as 'Federal Art', this style has been spreading like the great northern winds. Several masterpieces have already been created for the courts of other countries. If we invest in the movement while it is still in its infant years, we can secure a larger portion of the glory for ourselves."
pf_if.4.a: "Make sure we are a part of this exciting movement!"
pf_if.4.b: "We cannot afford to patronise them."
pf_if_federal_art_style: "Investing in Federal Art"

pf_if.5.t: "Peace in Our Time"

pf_if.5.a: "Excellent!"

pf_if.6.t: "Federal Embargo"
pf_if.6.d: "One of the most prolific traders has fallen foul of Federal guidelines and as a result has had a formal embargo issued against him. This is potentially disasterous for our networks and imports, but if we do not hand him over the Federation will surely come down harder against us in the future."

pf_if.6.b: "Respect the rule fo the Federation."
pf_if_smuggling: "Encouraging Smugglers"
pf_if_merchant_embargo: "Embargo on our Merchant"

pf_if.7.t: "Anti-Federation Sentiment"
pf_if.7.d: "There is a small faction within the elite of [Root.GetName] that distrusts the authority of the Federation, and continually campaigns for '[Root.GetAdjective] Independence. Their pretensions that we are forced to act at the whim of the Federal government is clearly nonsense, and we benefit immeasurably from their funding. Despite this, the protestors are getting increasingly uppity, and we will have to deal with them."
pf_if.7.a: "Let the police handle them."
pf_if.7.b: "Maybe they have some points..."

pf_if.8.t: "Good Advice"
pf_if.8.d: "The people we have picked to give advice to our government have proven themselves worth of the positions they occupy. With their assistance, we are running the state better than ever before."
pf_if.8.a: "Where would we be without them?"
pf_if.8.b: "Most of the credit is mine!"

pf_if.9.t: "Federation Strengthens Trade Laws"
pf_if.9.d: "The Grand Adirim of the Federation has decided to tighten existing Federal trade laws, hoping to stabilise the prices of basic goods within its jurisdiction and control the ambitions of greedy foreign merchants. While on the face of it this sounds like a good plan, many worry that keeping merchants out of our markets will do more harm than good to the amount and quality of our imports."
pf_if.9.a: "Okay."

pf_if.10.t: "Limits on Trade"
pf_if.10.d: "Trade is sometimes a dangerous endeavour. Storms, pirates, and worst of all, tariffs, make the daily lives of our hard-working merchants closer to hell than any man should experience. Some countries choose to impose laws to protect their merchants from daylight robbery, despite the protests of those who favour absolute free trade."
pf_if.10.a: "Institute laws to protect our merchants."
pf_if.10.b: "Continue to allow free trade."

pf_if.11.t: "Martial Desires"
pf_if.11.d: "War between the states of the Italian Federation is somewhat taboo, but that fact does not change the intrinsic desire within every human soul to fight. There is always more territory and more glory to be won. The nation longs for battle!"
pf_if.11.a: "Let us wage war!"
pf_if.11.b: "The law of the Federation mandates peace."

pf_if.12.t: "Burdens on the Military Establishment"
pf_if.12.d: "The cost of fighting has gotten much more expensive in recent years, with soaring prices for basic things like weaponry and armour putting many soldiers and officers off performing their service. In response, the state has started taking on more and more of the cost in an effort to keep the army running as usual, but despite this the crisis only seems to be getting worse."
pf_if.12.a: "We will have to take the brunt of the cost."
pf_if.12.b: "Spend every effort to ensure the crisis calms down."
pf_if_expensive_armies: "Increased Military Expenditure"

pf_if.13.t: "The Festival"
pf_if.13.d: "One of the most important festival days of the year is upon us! The worship of every god in the Punic pantheon is important, but some spark more joy and capture the imaginations of the people more effectively. The upcoming occassion is one such event, where the clergy expect to make a lot of money from people attending and buying icons and other souvenirs from the many shops that pop up along the path of the anticipated procession."
pf_if.13.a: "The state will give money to support this event!"
pf_if.13.b: "Let the clergy keep control of it."

pf_feast.1.t: "[Root.Monarch.GetName]'s Great Feast"
pf_feast.1.d: "The time has come to host a magnificent feast! The quality and length of the feast will depend on the amount of money we put into it. During a feast, various events can fire, involving interactions within the royal family, estates, leaders of foreign countries, advisors, and the Federation. The more expensive the feast, the better the events will be! Let us begin the preparations and decide what kind of feast it will shape up to be..."

pf_feast.2.t: "Nobles Quarrel"
pf_feast.2.d: "It began as a friendly conversation, but the effects of excessive drink and late nights have finally caught up on the jubilant attendees to our feast. Two of the realm's foremost aristocrats, [Root.noble_1.GetName] and [Root.noble_2.GetName], known for being long time friends, began a debate over whether Romans or Carthaginians ought to have won the Second Punic War. This debate rapidly developed into a spat, each taking offence to the other's view. Soon enough they were on the banqueting table wrestling each other, with a crowd gathered round cheering them on."
pf_feast.2.a: "Reprimand them both for improper behaviour"
pf_feast.2.b: "Join the debate, I have lots to say on this topic."
pf_feast.2.c: "Attempt to ignore them."

pf_feast.3.t: "Greedy Priest"
pf_feast.3.d: "An influential priest from one of our provinces, [Root.priest.GetName], has been noted for his excessive eating during the feast thusfar. Even the cooks are complaining they are being overworked in our attempts to accomodate this man, and the waiters are growing tired of marching back and forth from his table. To add to the insult, greed is one of the most prominent sins in our religion, and being a man of the robes he clearly knows this, but accepts his own hypocrisy."

Out of the corner of your eye you catch the [Root.Consort.GetTitle] at the other end of the room, standing there with [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] arms crossed, eying you up. As [Root.Consort.GetSheHe] approaches, you can already sense the anger contained, and the noise of your courtiers is momentarily drowned out.\n'Dearest, might we have a conversation together? In private?' [Root.Consort.GetTitle] [Root.Consort.GetName] sternly asks, a forced smile on [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] face."

pf_feast.6.t: "The Game of Old Ur"
pf_feast.6.d: "Since time immemorial, the Royal Game of Ur has been played upon the tables of kings, peasants, and all in between. Consisting of pieces which must be moved across a grid of squares safely, this game is reminiscent of many other classics, but for some odd reason, it has stuck around the longest. One of the more boisterous and ambitious nobles at the feast has challenged you, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], to a game - the gall! Nevertheless, there is some part of your mind convinced that victory in such a match would serve to show off your prowess to your subjects..."

[Root.Heir.GetName] has become so enamoured with the fighting however, that they have taken it even into the feasting hall!"

pf_feast.8.c: "No no please, carry on!"

pf_feast.9.a: "Isn't it amazing?"
pf_feast.9.b: "I'm so glad everyone is having a good time."

pf_feast.10.t: "The End of the Feast"
pf_feast.10.d: "At the head of the table, the noble [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] raised [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] goblet high, calling for a toast to mark the conclusion of the festivities. Wine goblets chimed, and laughter filled the hall as guests shared stories, songs, and jests. Bards in a corner of the hall struck up a lively tune, and couples began to dance, their colorful garments swirling like autumn leaves in a gentle breeze.\n\nThe last strains of music faded into the night, and the grand feast came to an end. The hall, now hushed and dimly lit, bore witness to the aftermath of the revelry. Empty goblets and half-filled platters remained, silent remnants of a celebration that would be remembered for years to come. As the building's inhabitants retired to their chambers, the echoes of laughter and the scent of roasted meats lingered in the air."
pf_feast.10.a: "It was a blast!"
pf_feast.10.b: "Until next time!"
pf_feast.10.c: "That was the best time of my life!"

pf_if.15.t: "The Fatal Blade"
pf_if.15.d: "Support for the regime has fallen to an all time low, and chaos has gripped the streets of the capital. Amidst the carnage, is a man with a recently sharpened knife and a set of radical ideas flying through his head. Slipping through unseen into the halls of the ministers, he manages to close in on the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], and then relieve him of his mortality with one swift movement of his arm. Like a ghost, he slips back into the crowd, never to be seen again."

When the Brigantes seized control over much of the north of Albion, his family was driven out into exile in the Brittonic Confederation in the south. There, the young man met Guinevere, a beautiful and capable princess of the Iceni, and discovered the love of his life. One night, while recovering from a terrible fever, he was visited in a dream by the eastern goddess Astarte, who commanded him to take up arms and reconquer Phoenicia for her true believers. Despite the unusual nature of his vision, he gathered a strong following and departed from the shores of Albion with his men in spring 1442. In the following year, they battled pirates and fierce storms, before finally making permanent landfall in Sicily. The band fought with the local king and seized nearly half the island, believing it would make a useful base of operations for their further campaigns. Now, Conan stands at a crossroads. His goddess still calls to him, like a siren ushering him closer to Phoenicia. But their travels have been years already, and many in his entourage are tired and wish to settle down in the rich lands they have just recently conquered. Yet Conan is still the master of his own fate - the world will bend and twist at his whim."
