#####EVENTS

 pf_ost.13.t:0 "Legacy of Old Ostholm"
 pf_ost.13.d:0 "Ostholm. A single man founded a single city. His family ruled over much of Ostgermania for better or worse depending on how far from Ostola you lived. Now it is the time to unshackle Donova from this old legacy and forge a new path for a new nation. It is not necessary to completely destroy the history that shaped our foundations but the influence of the Ostholm family has permeated all institutions and noble houses. To renounce them would leave a power vacuum which will likely followed by instability and chaos."
 pf_ost.13.a:0 "Light the fire!"
 pf_ost.13.b:0 "My Ancestors smile upon me!"

 pf_ost.14.t:0 "The Laws of the Southern Woods"
 pf_ost.14.d:0 "The Marcomanni followed the same creed as the rest of Ostgermania despite their much closer relationship with the other western germans. The cause of their belief came from their laws being copied by the Old Ostholm system, changed and adapted for their needs. Laws that for many seem much better suited for such a large country as ours, making sweeping changes to the relation between nobles and king, peasants and soldiers. The Sudeti nobility have changed these laws even further, but their reach is bound by their land."
 pf_ost.14.a:0 "Keep the Laws, change the words."
 pf_ost.14.b:0 "Write them and distribute them."
 pf_ost.14.c:0 "As long as they are written down."

By their own initiative, they have formulated a deal and planned in particular details what they need and what the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will have to give. All that remains to do is sign here, here and here."
 pf_ost.15.a:0 "We already know what their deal is."
 pf_ost.15.b:0 "Interesting. How's the interest on it?"
 pf_ost.15.c:0 "No Deal."

 pf_ost.16.t:0 "Born to Be Wild"
 pf_ost.16.d:0 "As Donova works to consolidate its grasps on its own people, many traditions find their way to obscurity. One tradition that refuses to go quietly in the dark night are the Vild Hunters, who are culturally bound to Vildheimer own noble guards. However many other nobles find these guard too bruttish and crude to properly protect them, so they are petitioning the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to put a stop to these Hunters."
 pf_ost.16.a:0 "Keep these Beasts down."
 pf_ost.16.b:0 "As long as no one is hurt."
 pf_ost.16.c:0 "Let the old traditions die."
 pf_ost.16.e:0 "Long live the Vild Hunt."

 pf_ost.17.t:0 "The Capital Question"

 pf_ost.17.b:0 "The City of Old Ostholm."
 pf_ost.17.c:0 "The City of Great River."
 pf_ost.17.e:0 "The City of Unbroken Fortitude."
 pf_ost.17.f:0 "The City of Grand Wealth."

 pf_ost.18.t:0 "Reforming Society"
 pf_ost.18.d:0 "The gradual winds of change are sweeping through our nation and many find that their wooden housing can no longer withstand them. Many are demanding great changes and grand ideological modifications, they will find that asking too much will only lead to be the one to gain nothing."

 pf_ost.19.t:0 "The Noble's Cause"
 pf_ost.19.d:0 "The Nobility of Old, New and recently bought are the backbone of the military and the creation of arts. What will they bring in this new founded nation and what problems they will cause will only strenghten our people resolve."
 pf_ost.19.a:0 "A Noble Lesson."

 pf_ost.20.t:0 "The Economical Foundation"
 pf_ost.20.d:0 "The Merchants stand on their piles of gold and protected wealth but without the stability of coinage and state, they would find themselves cold and lost. The economy of a nation can only be stable if the people and institution believe in it."
 pf_ost.20.a:0 "The Key is the Coin."

 pf_ost.21.t:0 "The Good Gods"
 pf_ost.21.d:0 "The Ostgermanic faith has brought us together and it holds us united. But the more our nation expands, the more new ideas and faiths we meet along the way. These faiths are being sponsored by foreign rulers to put pressure on us to change our ways which could considerably improve our relations with them."
 pf_ost.21.a:0 "Don't stray from the beaten path."
 pf_ost.21.b:0 "The ways of the Hellenes are most compelling."

 pf_ost.21.e:0 "We are God's chosen people!"

 pf_ost.22.t:0 "The Final Act"
 pf_ost.22.d:0 "The proper methods of governing a state have been carefully lead out in the previous days of hard work and dedication to a functioning society. Any mistake now and all the good that has been done can be unravalled easily and spiral the nation into chaos. The last act to be achieved is the foreign recognition of our nation by those that are more powerful or prestigious than us. To let them know our people and our country and where they stand under the Sun. Concessions will be made to those inside and outside to safely transition to a more civilized state."

 pf_ost.23.t:0 "Hunting the Drakon"
 pf_ost.23.d:0 "The people of the Strigodol tribes stood against the power of Old Ostholm and maintained their slavic faith and traditions.

 pf_ost.23.a:0 "The Dragon has been slain."
 pf_ost.23.b:0 "The Dragon has been tamed."

 pf_ost.24.t:0 "The Sudeten Deal"
 pf_ost.24.d:0 "Our new Advisor has brought to our attention that some areas around the capital require major renovations to properly represent our best to foreign diplomats.
