#####GOVERNMENT

#####EVENTS
 pf_ost.7.t:0 "Sudeten Proclamation"
 pf_ost.7.d:0 "Between mountains and hills the Marcomanni of the Sudeten live different lives to those outside them. New traditions and laws are shaping the culture to more resemble its eastern brethren, spurred on by differences in faith and bruttish Saxonic pressures. There are nobles who call for a new face to represent their new found culture and many are already calling themselves Sudeti. Some old houses still hold their Marcomanni traditions high, but without help from the Chief, they will eventually die out."
 pf_ost.7.a:0 "We are the Sudeti, proud and tall."
 pf_ost.7.b:0 "Our Markomann Brotherhood will hold strong."

 pf_ost.8.t:0 "The Tower of Tuisco"
 pf_ost.8.d:0 "Among the faithful, the mighty tower of Ostola, the Riesger Turm, built by Otto Ostholm in 784, stands as the greatest gift mortals can offer to the gods. Tuisco, grandfather of Ymir, created from the union of Earth and Sky, is the most venerated deity of our people. While divine spirits and faith are immortal and untouchable, the tower is in evident state of decay and the recent conquest of the city has not yet helped its chances of being repaired."
 pf_ost.8.a:0 "Renovated the Great Tower."
 pf_ost.8.b:0 "Renovated the city."

 pf_ost.9.t:0 "The Golden Ratio"
 pf_ost.9.d:0 "The mountains of Bergaland contain many metals that Sudeten also exports, and now that both lands are under the same state we can better coordinate how the mines operate. Gold is the lifeline of any country's economy and to ensure our coins are worth their own weight, we must secure gold mining never runs out. Expanding in Bergaland will make our newly conquered banks operate much more smoothly but will make the Sudeti gold mines less worth in the short run."
 pf_ost.9.a:0 "Fund more gold mines."
 pf_ost.9.b:0 "Ensure Sudeten golden exports."

 pf_ost.10.t:0 "Born to Be Wild"
 pf_ost.10.d:0 "The Vild Hunters are the most qualified and skilled horseman of all Ostgermania, but they are also extremely proud of being Vildheimer and do not pay any respect to new conquerors. The tradition of the Wild Hunt started all the way back to the founding of Biegenfluss, when one cadet branch of the Ostholm dynasty founded their cavalry regiments. The practice has been deemed an effective way to create sturdier knights and stronger horses, it could be made less cruel and more available to others."
 pf_ost.10.a:0 "Tame the Wild Hunters."
 pf_ost.10.b:0 "Allow the Wild Hunt to continue."

 pf_ost.11.t:0 "The Donovan Sublime Infrastructure"
 pf_ost.11.d:0 "The home of all Ostgermanic people is now fully under one singular banner, but the people are still separated by the natural boundaries of the world.Roads need to be built and cities connected, an effort that will be rewarded in the grand future that await us. However, the funds could be used to better the Sudeti homeland, leaving our conquered cities to rot."
 pf_ost.11.a:0 "We are Donovan."
 pf_ost.11.b:0 "We are Sudeti."
