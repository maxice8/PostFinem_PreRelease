URK_ideas_bonus: "Uruk Ambition"

urk_ancient_kingdom: "Legacy of Ancient Empires"
urk_ancient_kingdom_desc: "Our state is the successor to the great empires of old, the Babylonian, the Assyrian, and all those that arose from Mesopotamia before them. In coronation ceremonies our kings read out some of the many texts preserved from the reigns of past kings, ensuring that their memory remains fresh in the minds of all our people."
urk_defend_the_cities: "Defend the Cities"
urk_defend_the_cities_desc: "The cities we control our vulnerable, situated on vast flat plains and accessable from every angle. If we wish to retain our independence from our hungry neighbours, we must ensure our walls and fortifications are properly garrisoned at all times."
urk_syncretism: "Hellenic Syncretism"
urk_syncretism_desc: "When Alexander swept through these regions, he brought with him the Hellenic faith, which is still the dominant faith in this part of the world to the present day. Many of the peoples that made up his empire adopted this religion, but took it as syncretic with their pre-existing gods and traditions, creating a vibrant and new form of this old faith in every town in Mesopotamia."
urk_the_two_rivers: "The Two Rivers"
urk_the_two_rivers_desc: "Mesopotamia has always been the beating heart of civilisation, the golden core at the center of a hundred different empires. While it has faded into obscurity behind the now prosperous Mediterranean region, it has not however lost its agricultural supremacy. Between the Tigris and Euphrates lie some of the most abundant fertile soils in the world, producing massive quantities of high quality food goods to be exported far beyond our measly borders."
urk_restore_akkadian_texts: "Restore Academic Akkadian"
urk_restore_akkadian_texts_desc: "Long ago, the lingua franca of discourse and politics was Akkadian. Though it is now an extinct language, we retain it in many of our more ceremonial customs, in much the same way as the Italians still cling onto their vague memories of Latin. Our country should be an intellectual giant, and it is perhaps through promoting the Akkadian language as the medium of such invention and discussion that this can be achieved."
urk_restore_the_temples: "Restore the Temples"
urk_restore_the_temples_desc: "Every city in Mesopotamia had its own patron god prior to Hellenisation, with a grand temple within each citadel dedicated to them. Here, personal offerings and sacrifices could be made, and every citizen could feel like they had a personal connection with the divine. Despite such idolatry becoming increasingly shunned by the tyrannical Archon, we should revive this old practice in our territories."
urk_journeys_and_adventures: "Adventurers and Journeymen"
urk_journeys_and_adventures_desc: "Inspired by the tales of our ancestors and their conquests, as well as stories of heroes like the demi-god Gilgamesh, a number of our countrymen have journeyed out to the farthest corners of the world, seeking peril and glory. It just so happens that along the way, they learn vital information about the terrain and potential trade routes through these wild lands, leading to many adventurers being hired as a sort of vanguard for powerful mercant guilds."

BBY_ideas: "Babylonian Ideas"
BBY_ideas_start: "Babylonian Traditions"
BBY_ideas_bonus: "Babylonian Ambition"

bby_babylon_the_great: "Babylon the Great"
bby_babylon_the_great_desc: "Old Babylonia was a behemoth, a great power unlike anything else the world had yet seen. Its impact on the cultures around it is undeniable - many peoples trembled in fear upon the mention of the city's name, even using it as an epithet of sorts to describe later hegemonic cities like Carthage. This conception of 'Babylon the Great' is still present in many different customs, and with the restoration of our glorious empire the fears of our neighbours are certain to rapidly rise."
bby_astronomy: "Astronomy and Mathematics"
bby_astronomy_desc: "In ancient times Babylonia was a hub of astronomy and mathematics, a place ahead of its time. While many of the techniques and discoveries made by our ancestors have since been rediscovered in the Hellenic world and beyond, there is still room for more work to be done. Let us restore our country as a hub for scholars and the sciences more broadly, ensuring that we are always on the forefront of new knowledge."
bby_restored_legacy: "An Empire Reborn"
bby_restored_legacy_desc: "Babylon once controlled the largest empire in the history of the world, and while our state may be modest at the moment, we are sure that one day it will reach the same lofty heights. The world is ours for the taking, and our legitimate claims to vast swathes of territory are known to all. Let the reconquest begin!"
bby_agriculture: "Mesopotamian Hegemon"
bby_agriculture_desc: "The land between the two rivers, Mesopotamia, is as famously fertile and populated now just as it was thousands of years ago. Controlling it means we have a monopoly over its vast food production, and can thus control the export of our goods to foreign merchants. Once we have had our share, it would be wise to impose some hefty tariffs on our exported grain and foodstuffs, so that people all over know we are the empire that provides."
bby_imperial_commanders: "Imperial Commanders"
bby_imperial_commanders_desc: "Our predecessor empires fell in Mesopotamia fell apart due to the incompetence of their government, tribal invasions, but most significantly, sabotage from within. Even the mightiest state will crumble to ashes if its generals and important governors revolt. Let us be sure to keep the loyalty of the men we elevate to high power, picking them from a hand-selected group of capable noble sons, and granting them great gifts and praise when their tasks are completed well."
bby_restoration_of_religion: "Restore the Position of the Temples"
bby_restoration_of_religion_desc: "The temple was once the center of the communities that dotted the region. Priests served as both mediators with the gods and as administrators and diplomats. Those days are gone forever, and the era of formal governance and rapidly growing infrastructure is upon us. However, we will not abandon our communalist instincts so easily - we should restore the position of the temples and their priests, ensuring that the next generation grows up under firm religious guidance, surrounded by family and friends."
bby_stories_of_old: "Land of Epics"
bby_stories_of_old_desc: "A great many tales have been told throughout our long and storied history. Perhaps the most well known of these, the Epic of Gilgamesh, has continued in circulation since its creation some time in the distant past. With the growth of the printing industry and a rekindled fascination in old stories, these epics are once more spreading across the land, including far beyond our borders, with new translated and edited editions coming out every year."

PMY_ideas: "Palmyrene Ideas"
PMY_ideas_start: "Palmyrene Traditions"
PMY_ideas_bonus: "Palmyrene Ambition"

pmy_on_trade_routes: "Between Nowhere and Somewhere"
pmy_on_trade_routes_desc: "Palmyra was founded as a city on a trade route, and that trade has continued to comprise much of the local economy ever since. While our town is remote and often tricky to get to, it is a tranquil piece of shade in a vast and unforgiving desert. Let us use this prime position to attract merchants from all corners of the world to stop and use our services."
pmy_desert_terrain: "Amongst the Sand"
pmy_desert_terrain_desc: "The sand is everywhere. The sand is eternal. No matter where you look, there is sand. Sand on that dune, sand on the horizon. Coarse, rough, sand. We never really liked sand."
pmy_camel_riders: "Palmyrene Camel Riders"
pmy_camel_riders_desc: "Our town has been under attack many different times over the centuries, but most of them were fended off my our ferocious camel riders. Enemy armies, often on horseback, turn and flee at the sight of our finely trained beasts. Not only are they scary looking to foreigners, they are also expert desert navigators and survivors."
pmy_silk_road: "Silk Road Entrepot"
pmy_silk_road_desc: "The Silk Road runs from the far-off land of China all the way to Carthage, and carries with it goods of all kinds from silk to silver. Palmyra was built as a station along this route, serving wearing travellers and merchants with a place to rest and a fresh flask of water. During their stays here, we can often tempt these merchants to part with some of these goods, bringing great riches to our town."
pmy_soldier_rations: "Managed Soldier Rations"
pmy_soldier_rations_desc: "The long journeys across the desert to reach neighbouring towns drain both our spirits and our food reserves. If we wish to properly manage our armies in this tough climate, we must learn from the local tribal people who move through it every day with ease. A new way of rationing and storing our food must be implimented."
pmy_oases: "An Island of Prosperity"
pmy_oases_desc: "Our oasis is the lifeblood of our city. Without the comforting embrace of the lush greenery and the cool water, life in the desert would be practically impossible."
pmy_dreams_of_empire: "Dreams of Empire"
pmy_dreams_of_empire_desc: "Many people have reported having strange dreams. The story is often similar, and involves a respected figure showing them around what seems to be some kind of parallel version of our world. In that universe, Palmyra created a great empire, encompassing much of the eastern Mediterranean, and its rulers were known to historians even thousands of years later. While we may not reach such imaginary grandeur, we can certainly hold close to our hearts the united spirit we all share."

syr_gavras_conquests: "Gavrasian Conquest"
syr_gavras_conquests_desc: "As a boy, Callimachus dreamed of something more. Raised on the stories of Alexander and his men, the young prince was determined that his minor lordship in Damascus should expand to become a proper kingdom. After he succeeded his father to the throne, he spent every effort to realise this dream, and now we live in a time where a united Syria reigns supreme over the region, where hundreds of minor kings crowd into Callimachus' palace to give tribute, and where his authority as king is no longer questioned."
syr_trade_entrepot: "Merchants of Syria"
syr_trade_entrepot_desc: "The men of Syria are famous across the known world for their shrewd practices and negotiation skills, making them some of the finest merchants the world has ever known. They say that you can find a Syrian merchant in every mapped entrepot. While this may not be entirely truly, it is certainly testament to our widespread dominance and mercantile ambition."
syr_damascus_steel: "Damascus Steel"
syr_damascus_steel_desc: "Iron imported from the far east is treated and shaped by the skilled smiths of Damascus, and forged into a unique type of steel in local workshops. This steel is much stronger than anything produced by our competitors, and as such has been used to great success in producing swords and other pieces of military equipment. As long as we keep the secret to its strength to ourselves, our monopoly over Damascus steel will provide us with unparalleled strength."
syr_silk_road: "The Silk Road"
syr_silk_road_desc: "The Silk Road is a prestigious trade route that stretches from Carthage to China, and along the way passes through our lands. The settlements of Damascus and Palmyra function as major stop off points for merchants travelling along the road, leading to many luxurious items being traded off there, greatly enriching our own local merchants."
syr_decree_of_subordinance: "Decree of Subordinance"
syr_decree_of_subordinance_desc: "The conquests that won us this kingdom also resulted in the subjugation of a number of minor kings and princes, who now operate autonomously along our frontiers. While they provide somewhat regular tribute and profess their loyalty to us when needed, it is clear that their hearts are not entirely on our side. Let us introduce a new decree to be read to all our subject kings - we will not tolerate any disobedience, and all actions taken by these kings will be done with our consent."
syr_phoenician_trades: "Gateway to the World"
syr_phoenician_trades_desc: "Phoenicia has been a hub for merchants and wealth for thousands of years, and although it has fallen far since its heyday, it is still a force to be reckoned with. Under our dominion, the Phoenician cities are sharing some of their vast riches with us, leading to our profits soaring and exotic goods flooding into the country."
syr_well_watered_land: "One Syria, One Memory"
syr_well_watered_land_desc: "Out of what was once a minor principality in Damascus, we have forged a mighty kingdom. We must never forget our roots however - our heritage is just as important as the prosperity we know enjoy. Every Syrian must keep this knowledge in their hearts, else our humility will crack and the pride we embody will fail."

phoenician_bankers: "Invest in the Banking Sector"
phoenician_bankers_desc: "Many of the wealthy families in Phoenicia have turned to banking as a way to perpetuate their wealth down the generations. Our shared heritage and friendship with some of the families can secure us some favourable loans and advice from these financial experts."
phoenician_timber: "Cedar Forests"
phoenician_timber_desc: "Since antiquity, Phoenicia has been the best source of timber in the region. While new markets have opened up across the world, their quality will never match that of the trees that grow on our slopes."
phoenician_trades: "Phoenician Mercantile Prowess"
phoenician_trades_desc: "Phoenicia has always been home to powerful merchants and influential city states. Goods from pass through our ports into the hands of people all across the world, and as a result, our merchants have some of the best maps and use some of the most efficient trade routes known to man."
phoenician_cities: "Autonomous City States"
phoenician_cities_desc: "This land has always been divided up into its cities, chiefly the three jewels of Sidon, Tyre, and Byblos. Come what may, each city will make a stand to protect their independence, ensuring that our democracies stay intact and no foreign power can dictate the will of a Phoenician merchant."
phoenician_urbanisation: "Public Investment"
phoenician_urbanisation_desc: "The state exists for the purpose of serving and protecting the people, and thus it is only right if we use the vast reserves of wealth we have accumulated from our successful trading enterprises to invest in our cities' public infrastructure. Our cities will be the best places to live in, and the envy of the world."
phoenician_dye: "Tyrian Purple"
phoenician_dye_desc: "Produced solely from the sea snails that live off the coast of Tyre, Tyrian purple is a unique luxury dye that is still produced to this day by the dilligent craftspeople of our country. Over the years, it has become associated with royalty and particularly imperial rule, bringing the cities that export it great prestige and fame."
phoenician_goods: "The Factory System"
phoenician_goods_desc: "As economies across the world develop into extensions of the state, we must work to ensure that the will of our private citizens is never infringed upon by this process. Industrialisation must be done by the hard working men and women of Phoenicia by their own merit, and through this freedom, prosperity will be brought to the whole land."

greek_minor_ideas_1: "Alexander's Legacy"
greek_minor_ideas_1_desc: "Many centuries ago, Alexander the Great, a man of our own nation, swept through these lands as he created a mighty empire and an influence to stand the test of time. We should tap into his legacy to legitimise our own claims in the modern day."
greek_minor_ideas_2: "Hellenic Renaissance"

greek_minor_ideas_3: "Syncretism"
greek_minor_ideas_3_desc: "While we adhere to the Hellenic faith, there are still pockets of dissent within a sea of loyalty. Just like our ancestors did when they first came to these lands, we must learn to tolerate them and eventually absorb them into our own religion."
greek_minor_ideas_4: "Reunite the Greek Diaspora"
greek_minor_ideas_4_desc: "The Hellenistic Age deposited Greek minorities across the Middle East and beyond, many of whom would go on to found the dynasties that rule today. Using our shared heritage and language, we can connect with these despots more easily."
greek_minor_ideas_5: "Modernised Companion Cavalry"
greek_minor_ideas_5_desc: "Since antiquity the cavalry of the Hellenes has been feared the world over. Let us restore our venerable horseriding traditions, but adapt them for the increasingly competitive modern world."
greek_minor_ideas_6: "The Eastern Trades"
greek_minor_ideas_6_desc: "Our holdings in the east are the gateway for many exotic and luxury goods to come flooding into the Mediterranean via the Silk Road. With a few careful tariffs and investment in trade infrastructure, we will be able to squeeze the traders that pass through our lands down to their last pennies."
greek_minor_ideas_7: "Pan-Hellenism"

arm_azatavrear: "Azatavrear"
arm_azatavrear_desc: "The Armenian cavalry have for centuries been made up of the Azatavrear, an elite body of riders drawn from the nobility, often made up of the second and third sons of powerful landowners who stand to get little inheritance. Their tactics and terror are second to none, and the sight of one of our cavalry charges down the mountainside has been enough to make many enemy armies turns and flee."
arm_border_patrols: "Permanent Border Patrols"
arm_border_patrols_desc: "In times of peace, we must still be vigilant. Our country is surrounded by enemies, predators who would take every chance to cripple us and finally break our hold over southern Caucasia. We must thus always be ready for war. When they are not engaged in other duties, our army should patrol the borders and frontiers of our nation, protecting us from foreign threats and keeping the peace in the most vulnerable regions."
arm_home_of_the_reformation: "Home of the Reformation"
arm_home_of_the_reformation_desc: "Armenia has followed the Hellenic faith for a long time now, but its tenets and doctrines have never been completely satisfactory for us. Now that calls for a return to the pastoral, more decentralised traditional version of the religion are growing, many of our countrymen have found themselves drawn towards dissent. The concept of Armenian identity and pride are quickly being linked with adherence to reformist views, which promise to unite and reform our nation like nothing before it."
arm_memory_of_empire: "Memories of Empire"
arm_memory_of_empire_desc: "We once commanded a great empire, stretching from Persia to Jerusalem. While our state has shrunk greatly over the years, we still remember that golden age fondly, and many of our folk tales and legends are set there. With enough courage and patience, one day we will have an empire once more."
arm_strife: "Internal Stability"
arm_strife_desc: "Many rebellions and wars have plagued the Armenian homeland for generations, but it is only now that we are finally reaching a place of peace. A balance between the power of the king and the power of the estates must be achieved to bring lastin stability to the nation."
arm_nationalism: "Armenian Nationalism"

arm_governors: "Establish the Governorship"
arm_governors_desc: "The kingdom is vast and unmanageable by one central government, and always has been. To combat this, previous rulers partitioned their lands between different governors to ease the burden of administration, but oftentimes these governorships created little more than hotbeds for rebellion and unrest. Let us reform this system, and ensure only the most skilled, worthy, and loyal people are appointed as governors, subject to regular checks by the king."

cpd_agapian_revolution: "The Agapian Revolution"
cpd_agapian_revolution_desc: "The wicked republican government of Adana was overthrown in 1421 by a popular uprising, leading to a power vacuum that was easily exploited by our enemies. We lost territory in the east, the important city of Antioch, and perhaps the biggest blow of all, Cyprus. In the chaos, the young Telemachus Agapian seized power, presenting himself as the embodiment of providence and destiny, and promising to bring stability to the realm."
cpd_witches_familiar: "Witches' Familiar"
cpd_witches_familiar_desc: "Rumours constantly circulate about Telemachus' heritage, particularly about his relationship with his mother. The woman was a known witch, living in seclusion in a cave on Cyprus, and was often condemned for her forbidden brews and magic. It has been suggested that as a boy Telemachus was educated in these arts by her, and may retain some of that knowledge to this day."
cpd_free_ports: "Free Ports"
cpd_free_ports_desc: "Many consider our country unstable and potentially dangerous, and are therefore often reluctant to do any business with us. If we designate some select port towns along our coasts as 'free ports', where no tariffs or taxes can be collected, we can attempt to lure back the lucrative trade we once enjoyed."
cpd_city_state_governance: "Governance of the City"
cpd_city_state_governance_desc: "The old government of Adana, while corrupt and in dire need of reformation, was certainly a wealthy and impressive one. Festivals and feasts would be provided with more food than could be eaten by the city in a year, while the streets ran red with the finest Babylonian cloth, decorated with intricate patterns shaped from Indian gold. Every citizen wants to live in such luxury again - but some serious changes will have to be made to prevent the city from slipping back into its well-accustomed decadence"
cpd_leaders_of_the_revolution: "Righteous Reconquest"
cpd_leaders_of_the_revolution_desc: "We once controlled an expansive realm, stretching from sea to sea. But times have changed, and many new kingdoms and empires have risen and taken parts of what is rightfully ours. With a reformed military behind us, we will attract the finest generals from across the world to come and serve in our resurrection."
cpd_temples_above_all: "Theocracy"
cpd_temples_above_all_desc: "The gods are above all, always have been, always will be. The old government of Adana did not respect that - they saw themselves as their own gods, wealthy, powerful, and removed from the petty troubles of the mortals below them. It is time that our state restored the supremacy of the gods, and let their policies and guidance once again take the helm."
cpd_seize_the_day: "Seize the Day"
cpd_seize_the_day_desc: "Every moment is an opportunity, if you have the will to seize it. Let us never be idle and grow comfortable with our success - we must always push for more, expanding our horizons, scoring yet more victories. The only day we can rest is that holy one when our caskets are lowered into the ground, and at last the story of our deeds is over."

pf_bby.1.t: "The Reclamation of Babylon"
pf_bby.1.d: "Babylon has been the seat of emperors and kings for centuries. Since the Hellenic conquest of the region however, the city has fallen into disrepair, and is now a shadow of its former self. Our glorious reconquest of Babylon has however offered us a unique chance to pool the combined labour of our people to rebuild it and renovate its temples, helping the once mighty city to be reborn once more."
pf_bby.1.a: "Oh Babylon, we shall let no army defile you!"
pf_bby_babylon_nice: "Babylon Returned"

pf_bby.2.t: "Prosperity in Mesopotamia"
pf_bby.2.d: "Our conquest of Mesopotamia has brought peace and stability to an area that is all too often torn apart by wars and internal strife. The people feel safe under our governance, and for the first time in generations, the bountiful harvests the region is famous for are being reaped in full once more. Truly, this is a new golden age of Mesopotamian civilisation."
pf_bby.2.a: "Make hay while the sun shines..."

pf_bby.3.t: "Many Gods, Many Choices"
pf_bby.3.d: "Ours is a land of many different faiths and creeds. Before the Hellenic conquest, there were even more pagan religions present here, but most of them have now faded into obscurity, occupying only the minds of academics. The Archon has reigned supreme over our temples and the practices of our people for centuries now, and many have become complacent in that. Some fringe nationalists argue that our continued obedience to the Greek ways is humiliating, and that the thing that would be best for our country would be to turn to the works of those crusty scholars who have translated the texts of the old Mesopotamian faith, and attempt to rejuvinate that. This is clearly a ridiculous idea, but it is gaining some support both within the court and on the streets..."

pf_pho.1.t: "The Timber Industry"
pf_pho.1.d: "Since time immemorial, the cedar forests of the highlands of Phoenicia have served as the primary source of timber for much of the Middle East and beyond. Its quality and quantity was unparalleled elsewhere, and it was even so mythical and significant that the forest was said to be the home of the Mesopotamian gods. Now that we have seized control over this region and operate by only our own whims, we are free to do as we please with this abundance of timber."
pf_pho.1.a: "We should keep our timber for our own constructions."
pf_pho.1.b: "The whole world should know the quality of our timber."

pf_pho_local_timber_ex: "Local Timber Exports"

pf_pho.2.t: "Adoping the Royal Purple"
pf_pho.2.d: "Tyrian purple has been made in the city for thousands of years, and all that time it has been the source of both a great pride and a great stink for us. Despite the effort that needs to be put into it, the product is well worth it, fetching extraordinarily high prices abroad. Our purple clothes the kings and emperors of the world - should it not also bless our rulers?"
pf_pho.2.a: "We should take pride in our dyes!"
pf_pho.2.b: "We are so much more than just our colour!"
pf_pho_change_colour_to_purple_tt: "Our country will change its map colour to §PTyrian Purple§!."

pf_arm.1.t: "The Fall of the Kingdom of Armenia"
pf_arm.1.d: "Armenia has been home to a great kingdom for nearly two-thousand years. Throughout all that time, while our borders have certainly had their ebs and flows, no one ever thought to question whether the nation would remain intact. Recent decades have brought dark decades for Armenia however - the old incompetent king Tigranes XII still clings on desperately to both his life and his throne, squandering away the royal treasury on concubines and booze. In every province, the local governors are pushing for more and more autonomy and influence, sensing the great weakness at the heart of government and intending to exploit it fully.\n\nThe ambitions of one David, a noble by birth and originally governor of Tbilisi, have grown like a cancer within the realm, and now threaten to kill it entirely. Using his growing fame and power, he has gradually acquired territories across the north of our country, and has even begun styling himself as 'lord of the Georgians', a call back to a long-forgotten people and heritage that used to preside in that region. David's careful friendship with Tigranes has given his treason legitimacy and recognition, but all the other advisors to the court see what it really is. All we can do is buy time before he rebels fully against the crown, and even the gods cannot tell us what will happen then.\n\nThe eastern flank of Armenia defected long ago, and is now ruled by the upstart kingdom of Alarion. It may be a distant dream, but reunion with these lands would certainly go far in restoring the prestige of our kingdom. To the south, the Vanite vassals are growing increasing distant from affairs in Yerevan, and seem to be aligning themselves more and more with our rivals in Babylon than their legitimate lieges. Predators surround us from all sides, and yet the king does little but sit idly drinking away his days. These are dire times..."
pf_arm.1.a: "Perhaps this is the end of days?"
pf_arm_will_get_disaster_tt: "The disaster §YThe Fall of Armenia§! will start progressing."

pf_ath.4.t: "Kicking the Archon up the Arse"
pf_ath.4.d: "How it started is quite ridiculous - what began as a friendly game of darts in a tavern between the Bishop of [bishop_province.GetName] and a local priest has become a challenge of almighty proportions. After losing a series of matches, the Bishop has been forced by his own integrity to accept the forfeit - he was to kick the Archon up the arse. Fortunately for him, the Archon was visiting [Root.GetName] that very week, providing ample time for the deed to be done. After a lengthy discussion about the gods, the Bishop took his shot as the Archon bent over to tie his shoe. Word has reached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] quickly, and now it seems it is up to us to take charge of the situation."
pf_ath.4.a: "Try to convince the Archon the Bishop couldn't have done it."
pf_ath.4.b: "Force the Bishop to apologise for this impious act."
pf_ath.4.c: "Execute this Bishop for his crime!"
pf_ath.4.e: "I would quite like to boot him up the arse as well..."

Some of the best preserved remnants of ancient Mesopotamian civilisation that survives to the present day is their tablets, mostly meticulous records of transcations of grain and other goods. A few of them, however, peak the interest of our scholars. These tablets describe various ancient myths and stories, dictating the deeds of gods and men, from the enigmatic Ishtar to the tyrant king Gilgamesh.
