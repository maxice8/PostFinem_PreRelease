urk_ancient_kingdom: "Legacy of Ancient Empires"
urk_ancient_kingdom_desc: "Our state is the successor to the great empires of old, the Babylonian, the Assyrian, and all those that arose from Mesopotamia before them. In coronation ceremonies our kings read out some of the many texts preserved from the reigns of past kings, ensuring that their memory remains fresh in the minds of all our people."
urk_defend_the_cities: "Defend the Cities"
urk_defend_the_cities_desc: "The cities we control our vulnerable, situated on vast flat plains and accessable from every angle. If we wish to retain our independence from our hungry neighbours, we must ensure our walls and fortifications are properly garrisoned at all times."
urk_syncretism: "Hellenic Syncretism"
urk_syncretism_desc: "When Alexander swept through these regions, he brought with him the Hellenic faith, which is still the dominant faith in this part of the world to the present day. Many of the peoples that made up his empire adopted this religion, but took it as syncretic with their pre-existing gods and traditions, creating a vibrant and new form of this old faith in every town in Mesopotamia."
urk_the_two_rivers: "The Two Rivers"
urk_the_two_rivers_desc: "Mesopotamia has always been the beating heart of civilisation, the golden core at the center of a hundred different empires. While it has faded into obscurity behind the now prosperous Mediterranean region, it has not however lost its agricultural supremacy. Between the Tigris and Euphrates lie some of the most abundant fertile soils in the world, producing massive quantities of high quality food goods to be exported far beyond our measly borders."
urk_restore_akkadian_texts: "Restore Academic Akkadian"
urk_restore_akkadian_texts_desc: "Long ago, the lingua franca of discourse and politics was Akkadian. Though it is now an extinct language, we retain it in many of our more ceremonial customs, in much the same way as the Italians still cling onto their vague memories of Latin. Our country should be an intellectual giant, and it is perhaps through promoting the Akkadian language as the medium of such invention and discussion that this can be achieved."
urk_restore_the_temples: "Restore the Temples"
urk_restore_the_temples_desc: "Every city in Mesopotamia had its own patron god prior to Hellenisation, with a grand temple within each citadel dedicated to them. Here, personal offerings and sacrifices could be made, and every citizen could feel like they had a personal connection with the divine. Despite such idolatry becoming increasingly shunned by the tyrannical Archon, we should revive this old practice in our territories."
urk_journeys_and_adventures: "Adventurers and Journeymen"
urk_journeys_and_adventures_desc: "Inspired by the tales of our ancestors and their conquests, as well as stories of heroes like the demi-god Gilgamesh, a number of our countrymen have journeyed out to the farthest corners of the world, seeking peril and glory. It just so happens that along the way, they learn vital information about the terrain and potential trade routes through these wild lands, leading to many adventurers being hired as a sort of vanguard for powerful mercant guilds."
