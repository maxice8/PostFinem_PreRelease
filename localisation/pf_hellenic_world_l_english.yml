URK_ideas: "Uruk Ideas"
URK_ideas_start: "Uruk Traditions"
URK_ideas_bonus: "Uruk Ambition"

urk_ancient_kingdom: "Legacy of Ancient Empires"
urk_ancient_kingdom_desc: "Our state is the successor to the great empires of old, the Babylonian, the Assyrian, and all those that arose from Mesopotamia before them. In coronation ceremonies our kings read out some of the many texts preserved from the reigns of past kings, ensuring that their memory remains fresh in the minds of all our people."
urk_defend_the_cities: "Defend the Cities"
urk_defend_the_cities_desc: "The cities we control our vulnerable, situated on vast flat plains and accessable from every angle. If we wish to retain our independence from our hungry neighbours, we must ensure our walls and fortifications are properly garrisoned at all times."
urk_syncretism: "Hellenic Syncretism"
urk_syncretism_desc: "When Alexander swept through these regions, he brought with him the Hellenic faith, which is still the dominant faith in this part of the world to the present day. Many of the peoples that made up his empire adopted this religion, but took it as syncretic with their pre-existing gods and traditions, creating a vibrant and new form of this old faith in every town in Mesopotamia."
urk_the_two_rivers: "The Two Rivers"
urk_the_two_rivers_desc: "Mesopotamia has always been the beating heart of civilisation, the golden core at the center of a hundred different empires. While it has faded into obscurity behind the now prosperous Mediterranean region, it has not however lost its agricultural supremacy. Between the Tigris and Euphrates lie some of the most abundant fertile soils in the world, producing massive quantities of high quality food goods to be exported far beyond our measly borders."
urk_restore_akkadian_texts: "Restore Academic Akkadian"
urk_restore_akkadian_texts_desc: "Long ago, the lingua franca of discourse and politics was Akkadian. Though it is now an extinct language, we retain it in many of our more ceremonial customs, in much the same way as the Italians still cling onto their vague memories of Latin. Our country should be an intellectual giant, and it is perhaps through promoting the Akkadian language as the medium of such invention and discussion that this can be achieved."
urk_restore_the_temples: "Restore the Temples"
urk_restore_the_temples_desc: "Every city in Mesopotamia had its own patron god prior to Hellenisation, with a grand temple within each citadel dedicated to them. Here, personal offerings and sacrifices could be made, and every citizen could feel like they had a personal connection with the divine. Despite such idolatry becoming increasingly shunned by the tyrannical Archon, we should revive this old practice in our territories."
urk_journeys_and_adventures: "Adventurers and Journeymen"
urk_journeys_and_adventures_desc: "Inspired by the tales of our ancestors and their conquests, as well as stories of heroes like the demi-god Gilgamesh, a number of our countrymen have journeyed out to the farthest corners of the world, seeking peril and glory. It just so happens that along the way, they learn vital information about the terrain and potential trade routes through these wild lands, leading to many adventurers being hired as a sort of vanguard for powerful mercant guilds."

BBY_ideas: "Babylonian Ideas"
BBY_ideas_start: "Babylonian Traditions"
BBY_ideas_bonus: "Babylonian Ambition"

bby_babylon_the_great: "Babylon the Great"
bby_babylon_the_great_desc: "Old Babylonia was a behemoth, a great power unlike anything else the world had yet seen. Its impact on the cultures around it is undeniable - many peoples trembled in fear upon the mention of the city's name, even using it as an epithet of sorts to describe later hegemonic cities like Carthage. This conception of 'Babylon the Great' is still present in many different customs, and with the restoration of our glorious empire the fears of our neighbours are certain to rapidly rise."
bby_astronomy: "Astronomy and Mathematics"
bby_astronomy_desc: "In ancient times Babylonia was a hub of astronomy and mathematics, a place ahead of its time. While many of the techniques and discoveries made by our ancestors have since been rediscovered in the Hellenic world and beyond, there is still room for more work to be done. Let us restore our country as a hub for scholars and the sciences more broadly, ensuring that we are always on the forefront of new knowledge."
bby_restored_legacy: "An Empire Reborn"
bby_restored_legacy_desc: "Babylon once controlled the largest empire in the history of the world, and while our state may be modest at the moment, we are sure that one day it will reach the same lofty heights. The world is ours for the taking, and our legitimate claims to vast swathes of territory are known to all. Let the reconquest begin!"
bby_agriculture: "Mesopotamian Hegemon"
bby_agriculture_desc: "The land between the two rivers, Mesopotamia, is as famously fertile and populated now just as it was thousands of years ago. Controlling it means we have a monopoly over its vast food production, and can thus control the export of our goods to foreign merchants. Once we have had our share, it would be wise to impose some hefty tariffs on our exported grain and foodstuffs, so that people all over know we are the empire that provides."
bby_imperial_commanders: "Imperial Commanders"
bby_imperial_commanders_desc: "Our predecessor empires fell in Mesopotamia fell apart due to the incompetence of their government, tribal invasions, but most significantly, sabotage from within. Even the mightiest state will crumble to ashes if its generals and important governors revolt. Let us be sure to keep the loyalty of the men we elevate to high power, picking them from a hand-selected group of capable noble sons, and granting them great gifts and praise when their tasks are completed well."
bby_restoration_of_religion: "Restore the Position of the Temples"
bby_restoration_of_religion_desc: "The temple was once the center of the communities that dotted the region. Priests served as both mediators with the gods and as administrators and diplomats. Those days are gone forever, and the era of formal governance and rapidly growing infrastructure is upon us. However, we will not abandon our communalist instincts so easily - we should restore the position of the temples and their priests, ensuring that the next generation grows up under firm religious guidance, surrounded by family and friends."
bby_stories_of_old: "Land of Epics"
bby_stories_of_old_desc: "A great many tales have been told throughout our long and storied history. Perhaps the most well known of these, the Epic of Gilgamesh, has continued in circulation since its creation some time in the distant past. With the growth of the printing industry and a rekindled fascination in old stories, these epics are once more spreading across the land, including far beyond our borders, with new translated and edited editions coming out every year."

PMY_ideas: "Palmyrene Ideas"
PMY_ideas_start: "Palmyrene Traditions"
PMY_ideas_bonus: "Palmyrene Ambition"

pmy_on_trade_routes: "Between Nowhere and Somewhere"
pmy_on_trade_routes_desc: "Palmyra was founded as a city on a trade route, and that trade has continued to comprise much of the local economy ever since. While our town is remote and often tricky to get to, it is a tranquil piece of shade in a vast and unforgiving desert. Let us use this prime position to attract merchants from all corners of the world to stop and use our services."
pmy_desert_terrain: "Amongst the Sand"
pmy_desert_terrain_desc: "The sand is everywhere. The sand is eternal. No matter where you look, there is sand. Sand on that dune, sand on the horizon. Coarse, rough, sand. We never really liked sand."
pmy_camel_riders: "Palmyrene Camel Riders"
pmy_camel_riders_desc: "Our town has been under attack many different times over the centuries, but most of them were fended off my our ferocious camel riders. Enemy armies, often on horseback, turn and flee at the sight of our finely trained beasts. Not only are they scary looking to foreigners, they are also expert desert navigators and survivors."
pmy_silk_road: "Silk Road Entrepot"
pmy_silk_road_desc: "The Silk Road runs from the far-off land of China all the way to Carthage, and carries with it goods of all kinds from silk to silver. Palmyra was built as a station along this route, serving wearing travellers and merchants with a place to rest and a fresh flask of water. During their stays here, we can often tempt these merchants to part with some of these goods, bringing great riches to our town."
pmy_soldier_rations: "Managed Soldier Rations"
pmy_soldier_rations_desc: "The long journeys across the desert to reach neighbouring towns drain both our spirits and our food reserves. If we wish to properly manage our armies in this tough climate, we must learn from the local tribal people who move through it every day with ease. A new way of rationing and storing our food must be implimented."
pmy_oases: "An Island of Prosperity"
pmy_oases_desc: "Our oasis is the lifeblood of our city. Without the comforting embrace of the lush greenery and the cool water, life in the desert would be practically impossible."
pmy_dreams_of_empire: "Dreams of Empire"
pmy_dreams_of_empire_desc: "Many people have reported having strange dreams. The story is often similar, and involves a respected figure showing them around what seems to be some kind of parallel version of our world. In that universe, Palmyra created a great empire, encompassing much of the eastern Mediterranean, and its rulers were known to historians even thousands of years later. While we may not reach such imaginary grandeur, we can certainly hold close to our hearts the united spirit we all share."

pf_bby.1.t: "The Reclamation of Babylon"
pf_bby.1.d: "Babylon has been the seat of emperors and kings for centuries. Since the Hellenic conquest of the region however, the city has fallen into disrepair, and is now a shadow of its former self. Our glorious reconquest of Babylon has however offered us a unique chance to pool the combined labour of our people to rebuild it and renovate its temples, helping the once mighty city to be reborn once more."

pf_bby.2.d: "Our conquest of Mesopotamia has brought peace and stability to an area that is all too often torn apart by wars and internal strife. The people feel safe under our governance, and for the first time in generations, the bountiful harvests the region is famous for are being reaped in full once more. Truly, this is a new golden age of Mesopotamian civilisation."
pf_bby.2.a: "Make hay while the sun shines..."

pf_bby.3.t: "Many Gods, Many Choices"
pf_bby.3.d: "Ours is a land of many different faiths and creeds. Before the Hellenic conquest, there were even more pagan religions present here, but most of them have now faded into obscurity, occupying only the minds of academics. The Archon has reigned supreme over our temples and the practices of our people for centuries now, and many have become complacent in that. Some fringe nationalists argue that our continued obedience to the Greek ways is humiliating, and that the thing that would be best for our country would be to turn to the works of those crusty scholars who have translated the texts of the old Mesopotamian faith, and attempt to rejuvinate that. This is clearly a ridiculous idea, but it is gaining some support both within the court and on the streets..."

These tablets describe various ancient myths and stories, dictating the deeds of gods and men, from the enigmatic Ishtar to the tyrant king Gilgamesh.
