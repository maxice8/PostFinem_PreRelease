pf_althingi.1.t: "Successful Tax Collecting"
pf_althingi.1.d: "Although Iceland has no government, we still collect a form of taxation to sponsor island-wide policies and building projects decided at Thingvellir. Recently, our tax collectors have reported a remarkable rate of pay, indicating that our people are wealthy and happy to share that wealth."
pf_althingi.1.a: "What wonderful news!"
pf_althingi.1.b: "We can always get more out of our taxes."

pf_althingi.2.t: "Tyrannical Landlords"
pf_althingi.2.d: "Much of the lands of island are leased from landlords, some of which are very wealthy and powerful compared to their tenants. Despite this, many of these poor tenant farmers complain that they are exploited by the landlords, and that their rents are startlingly high for the size of the land they get to live on."
pf_althingi.2.a: "Punish the landlords."
pf_althingi.2.b: "Ignore their complaints."

pf_althingi.3.t: "Extending Fishing Rights"
pf_althingi.3.d: "Iceland is a land surrounded by rich stocks of fish, the envy of many of our mercantile friends on the continent. Some of our fishermen have designated portions of the sea for their sole use, but these areas always come into competition with others of our own nation and abroad."
pf_althingi.3.a: "Ensure the Icelanders are respected."
pf_althingi.3.b: "We must come to an agreement with these foreigners."

pf_althingi.4.t: "Tough Folk"
pf_althingi.4.d: "Foreigners who come to Iceland often complain about the brash and rude manner of speaking we have, and claim that the whole island and its population come off as very offensive to them. Whether they are just sensitive or we really are rude, we do not know, but something must be done about this."
pf_althingi.4.a: "Perhaps we can try talking slower?"
pf_althingi.4.b: "Let them complain, we will not bend at the whim of foreigners."

pf_althingi.5.t: "Sword Training"
pf_althingi.5.d: "While our island is often left alone by raiders and pirates, we must always be ready to defend our homeland. Some have suggested we get the men of the island involved in sword training, so that when the time comes every man will have the skill he needs to fight properly."
pf_althingi.5.a: "Get every man involved!"
pf_althingi.5.b: "We had better select a few good men for this."

pf_althingi.6.t: "Singing the Sagas"
pf_althingi.6.d: "The recorded history of our nation and people comprise what are known as the Sagas, which are often sung by our people and transmitted from generation to generation orally. However, some of the younger sons of the gentry are having a rebellious phase and refuse to take part in this venerable tradition. What shall we do with these little brats?"
pf_althingi.6.a: "Introduce a punishment for not singing."
pf_althingi.6.b: "We cannot restrict their freedom of speech."
