swe_runes_and_sagas_desc: "Ours is a land of stories, transferred down the generations orally and performed to budding young audiences. The traditions and history of our people is preserved in these tales, and is even codified by some learned men turned into sagas."
swe_eagle_of_the_north: "The Eagle of the North"
swe_eagle_of_the_north_desc: "Sweden has risen from a small state in the northern forests to the chief of the Nordic kingdoms, more powerful than any of our ancestors could imagine. Like the sun itself, the eagle of Sweden will rule from horizon to horizon!"
swe_power_of_the_jarl: "Jarlmikill"
swe_power_of_the_jarl_desc: "In times long passed kings held mostly informal power, and acted more as war chiefs than actual monarchs. Now, we live in a new era of strong leadership and formalised government, where more and more power is concentrated in the hands of the king."
swe_timber_exports: "Tend to the Forests"
swe_timber_exports_desc: "The great forests of the north are treacherous and vast, but they are also one of biggest sources of income.

swe_realm_of_the_north_desc: "The Swedish nation is rapidly becoming the foremost power in northern Europe, propelled by the spirit and zeal of our people, but the influence of the king cannot be understated.

pf_althingi.1.t: "Successful Tax Collecting"
pf_althingi.1.d: "Although Iceland has no government, we still collect a form of taxation to sponsor island-wide policies and building projects decided at Thingvellir. Recently, our tax collectors have reported a remarkable rate of pay, indicating that our people are wealthy and happy to share that wealth."
pf_althingi.1.a: "What wonderful news!"
pf_althingi.1.b: "We can always get more out of our taxes."

pf_althingi.2.t: "Tyrannical Landlords"
pf_althingi.2.d: "Much of the lands of island are leased from landlords, some of which are very wealthy and powerful compared to their tenants. Despite this, many of these poor tenant farmers complain that they are exploited by the landlords, and that their rents are startlingly high for the size of the land they get to live on."
pf_althingi.2.a: "Punish the landlords."
pf_althingi.2.b: "Ignore their complaints."

pf_althingi.3.t: "Extending Fishing Rights"
pf_althingi.3.d: "Iceland is a land surrounded by rich stocks of fish, the envy of many of our mercantile friends on the continent. Some of our fishermen have designated portions of the sea for their sole use, but these areas always come into competition with others of our own nation and abroad."
pf_althingi.3.a: "Ensure the Icelanders are respected."
pf_althingi.3.b: "We must come to an agreement with these foreigners."

pf_althingi.4.t: "Tough Folk"
pf_althingi.4.d: "Foreigners who come to Iceland often complain about the brash and rude manner of speaking we have, and claim that the whole island and its population come off as very offensive to them. Whether they are just sensitive or we really are rude, we do not know, but something must be done about this."
pf_althingi.4.a: "Perhaps we can try talking slower?"
pf_althingi.4.b: "Let them complain, we will not bend at the whim of foreigners."

pf_althingi.5.t: "Sword Training"
pf_althingi.5.d: "While our island is often left alone by raiders and pirates, we must always be ready to defend our homeland. Some have suggested we get the men of the island involved in sword training, so that when the time comes every man will have the skill he needs to fight properly."
pf_althingi.5.a: "Get every man involved!"
pf_althingi.5.b: "We had better select a few good men for this."

pf_althingi.6.t: "Singing the Sagas"
pf_althingi.6.d: "The recorded history of our nation and people comprise what are known as the Sagas, which are often sung by our people and transmitted from generation to generation orally. However, some of the younger sons of the gentry are having a rebellious phase and refuse to take part in this venerable tradition. What shall we do with these little brats?"
pf_althingi.6.a: "Introduce a punishment for not singing."
pf_althingi.6.b: "We cannot restrict their freedom of speech."

pf_deities.2.t: "Sacrificing to the Gods at Uppsala"
pf_deities.2.d: "The Uppsala Temple contains three great wooden statues of gods, each of which has its own dedicated priest and cult associated with it. The statue of Thor is sacrificed to in times of famine and plague, when the people need desperately food and health. The statue of Freyr grants desires of marriage and fertility, and its often a favourite of kings and queens in need of an heir. Finally, the statue of Odin is sacrificed to in times of war and conflict, perhaps the most vital sport of our people. Our needs are many, but our focus can only be on one issue. To which god should we sacrifice?\n\nWe will be able to sacrifice to a god if we have an advisor employed in that monarch power category to be sacrificed. If we do no, the option will not show."
pf_deities.2.a: "Sacrifice to Thor."
pf_deities.2.b: "Sacrifice to Freyr."
pf_deities.2.c: "Sacrifice to Odin."
pf_deities.2.dd: "Go back."
god_thor_sacrifice: "Sacrificed to Thor"
god_freyr_sacrifice: "Sacrificed to Freyr"
god_odin_sacrifice: "Sacrificed to Odin"

pf_nordic.1.t: "The Uppsala Auðr"
pf_nordic.1.d: "The seat of the kings of Sweden has always been Uppsala, the site of the great Temple and also the seat of Freyr's ancient kingship. It is to Freyr that we owe one of our most important traditions, the Uppsala auðr. This collection of estates was first gathered by the god long ago to ensure the wealth and maintenance of future kings, and this practice has proven to be very beneficial in the years since. Now extending across several provinces and containing more territory than the lands of many magnates combined, this space of land is a testament to the command and power of the King."
pf_nordic.1.a: "Strengthen this venerable practice."
pf_nordic.1.b: "Perhaps we can sell part of this land for more short term income?"
