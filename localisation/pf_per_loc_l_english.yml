 pf_per_events_119_desc: "Despite our rejection of Rahbar Jawed and his thinking, we have recently been increasingly struggling to manage the numbers of heathens coming under our control. They have been making up an ever-growing portion of our population and demanding more and more rights. Much of our core population is angry that we are making any attempt to placate them and call for a return to our past policies of forcing the true faith upon our population. Some are going as far as to call for an inquisition amongst the entire country, which would represent a total reversal of our recent policies."
 pf_per_events_119_option_1: "Our people must learn to live together!"
 pf_per_events_119_option_2: "We were wrong to reject Jawed, it's time for an inquisition!"

 pf_persian_empire_religious_question_title: "The Question of Heresy"

 pf_per_appeal_to_religion_desc: "One of the only things the Dastur and the Satrapies agree on is matters of faith. Perhaps by showing our devotion to the faith we can convince them of our just intentions."
 pf_per_raise_the_army_desc: "In order to successfully deal with this uprising we must raise a strong army and crush armed rebellions with force."
 pf_per_find_allies_desc: "Using the exquisite diplomatic skills of the Dastur, we should easily be able to find some allies that can assist us with this threat. Of course, we should only consider those of the true faith in our search, filthy heretics are still out of the question."
 pf_per_end_the_revolt_desc: "We have finally ended the open conflict between us and the Satrapies. The future of Persia is uncertain, but there is no one better than the Dastur to lead us through it."
 pf_per_show_our_strength_desc: "By showing the power of our armies on an equally sized foe we can intimidate the Satrapies into conceding defeat to our superior strength."
 pf_per_divide_and_conquer_desc: "The Satrapies only have any power because they have united against us. If we can convince one of them to join our side it will be much easier to convince the rest."
 pf_per_cross_the_strait_desc: "The Straits of Hormuz are a vital chokepoint for maritime trade. By establishing a power base on the opposite side of the strait we can begin to monopolise it, shutting down heathen merchants and supporting our own."
 pf_per_control_hormuz_desc: "With both sides of the Straits of Hormuz now firmly under our control we can institute a toll on all merchants passing through, which is sure to be incredibly lucrative."
 pf_per_secure_the_gulf_desc: "The Gulf of Persia has been an important trading center for centuries. With all of its ports now firmly under control we can patrol all of our internal waters, clearing out any pirates or heretics and ensuring our new internal sea becomes a hub of economic activity."
 pf_per_trade_with_faithful_desc: "Further along the coast are a small number of Zoroastrian states along the Coast of Gujarat. By instituting friendly relations or taking direct control of some of the most vital ports there we can extend our maritime trade routes from Basra in the West to Surat in the East."
 pf_per_dominate_tigris_desc: "The River Tigris has been home to civilisations for thousands of years. Its fertile banks have fed people since the beginning of civilisation itself. It is high time we took direct control of these valuable lands."
 pf_per_destroy_seleucia_desc: "The last remnants of the vile Seleucid Empire are a sore on any map. Once they were harsh tyrants imposing their heretic ways upon the peaceful people of Persia, but we rose to the call and drove them out of homeland. It is time to deal the finishing blow."
 pf_per_restore_baghdad_desc: "Babylon was one of the most important cities of the ancient world. It was the capital of several empires over the millenia, but under the rule of the filthy Hellenes it has fallen into disarray. We must restore this city to the shining jewel it used to be!"
 pf_per_fulfil_satrapies_desc: "As part of the Satrapy Expansion Plan we are so tragically beholden to some of our existing Satrapies have laid claim to nearby provinces. While we don't particularly care what they lay claim to, it would be a reasonable justification for our expansion and should placate them for now."
 pf_per_reach_caucasus_desc: "The Caucasus mountain range has served as a natural barrier preventing the barbarians in the north from invading further south. Of course, these pathetic Hellenic states cannot be trusted to guard such an important border - we shall simply have to do it ourselves."
 pf_per_establish_control_desc: "We have finally managed to pass some basic legal reforms without our insolent Satraps taking up arms against us! As our conquests bring us further prestige and the Satrapies are grateful for our generous assistance, we finally find ourselves in control of our own destiny."
 pf_per_drive_back_hordes_desc: "The barbaric tribes to our north are good for nothing but pillaging and raiding! In time we will set up proper defenses against them but first we must drive them back, taking control of the fertile lands just north of the border."
 pf_per_build_good_wall_desc: "Merchants from China speak of a 'Great Wall', thousands and thousands of miles long, that the emperors there built along their northern border to keep out the barbarians to their north. While such a feat of construction is certainly impressive, we probably don't need anything quite so extreme."
 pf_per_assist_satrapies_desc: "The demands of the Satraps are endless and they are impossible to fully satisfy. However, perhaps our policy of turning away their envoys without even listening could be reworked. If we accept some of their most trivial demands we may be able to placate them for a while."
 pf_per_invade_india_desc: "The Indian Subcontinent is a land of many riches. We have also heard tales of the oppression of practicers of the one true faith there. The reliability of those tales isn't too important, we'll just have to investigate ourselves."
 pf_per_crush_multan_desc: "The City of Multan is a prosperous city filled with practicers of the true faith. It has great potential to become a major contributor to our economy and an excellent capital for our new Satrapy. We'll just have to dispose of its current occupants first."
 pf_per_invade_kashmir_desc: "As Persians we are fond of mountainous terrain. It's defensible, has incredible views, and we have built great cities there in our homeland. The mountains of Kashmir therefore make perfect sense as early targets of our Indian expansion."
 pf_per_liberate_zoroastrians_desc: "We have heard tragic tales of terrible treatment of Zoroastrians under the Muslim states of India. We have no choice left but to invade them and liberate the communities of the faithful there ourselves."
 pf_per_unity_in_faith_desc: "As our realm expands and the number of Satrapies grows, one thing binds us all together - our faith. By investing in temples in all of our Satrapies and joining them in worship, we can strengthen the ties between us."
 pf_per_trade_in_persia_desc: "The great expanse of our lands produce a wide array of exotic goods. At the heart of it all, we have quickly found ourselves a hub of trade. By effectively controlling the trade that flows through our lands we can turn a great profit."
 pf_per_merchant_class_desc: "With the further expansion of trade throughout our lands, a number of prominent merchants have accumulated great wealth and power within our nation. Perhaps by granting them freedoms to do what they do best we can mutually benefit?"
 pf_per_invest_in_satrapies_desc: "We have received some complaints from the Satrapies that we are focusing our development on our own lands. Indeed our Satrapies have some cities with great potential. Investing in their economies is sure to benefit us as much as it does them."
 pf_per_converge_on_tabrizia_desc: "Having all but encircled the tiny state of Tabrizia, it is all but a mercy to put them out of their misery and seize the territory for ourselves."
 pf_per_invade_armenia_desc: "Armenia is filled with our favourite type of terrain - the mountains. We should seize some for ourselves at the earliest opportunity, ideally before the heretics in Macedonia get their hands on it."
 pf_per_defend_the_mountains_desc: "Now that we have secured some mountains on our western front, it only makes sense to fortify them carefully with our best fortress designs. Surely this will dissuade anyone from even thinking of trying to invade us."
 pf_per_embrace_renaissance_desc: "The ideas of the renaissance are spreading through our western neighbours, marked by an reinvigorated interest in the ancient civilisations of our past. Indeed, we have a long a storied past to learn from as well."
 pf_per_develop_mountain_cities_desc: "Our architects have all but perfected the art of building in tall mountain ranges, whether it be defensible forts or large population centres, we can build it. Now we must apply this knowledge to all parts of our vast lands and continue to develop our homeland."
 pf_per_continue_expansion_desc: "Truly we have shown the might of the Persians for all the world to see. Our realm is expansive, our Satraps answer our every request and we truly are the masters of our own destiny. Surely, nothing can stop us now from achieving what was once but a fool's suggestion."
 pf_per_push_western_india_desc: "The riches of Western India have become irresistible for our great state. The time has come to bring this region under our control and integrate it into our administration. Though, the nation of Gujarat has been particularly keen to work with us. Perhaps there is an opportunity for the Dastur to exercise his diplomatic prowess..."
 pf_per_deal_gujarat_desc: "With the state of Gujarat totally convinced of our righteousness we shall make them an invitation to become our Satrapy, one that they cannot possibly refuse. Truly the prowess of our Dastur's diplomacy knows no bounds. Unless of course that fell through, in which case it was probably never possible in the first place."
 pf_per_defender_of_faith_desc: "With the last of the Zoroastrians in India freed from the tyranny of heresy, we have proven ourselves to all Zoroastrians that we shall be their great protector. In no other hands could such a responsibility be placed, but for us it is natural."
 pf_per_unify_religion_and_state_desc: "Under the rule of our magnificent theocracy Zoroastrianism has seen a resurgence never seen before. At the helm of it all, our great Dastur, highest priest of all Zoroastrians. Of course, the help of the Mobeds has been useful, and the time has come to integrate them officially into our administration, uniting Religion and State as one."
 pf_per_conquer_armenia_desc: "With the full range of the Caucasus mountains fully under our control we can finally give the people of this region the protection they deserve. No longer shall the barbarians of the north raid them, nor the Hellenes of the west. As long as they convert to the true faith of course."
 pf_per_fortify_the_border_desc: "Despite our best efforts those that follow the Hellenic faith still exist to our west. In particular, the heretics in Macedonia still represent a threat to our great nation. With the construction of our newest designs of mountain fortresses however, any attempts they may make to threaten us will be futile."
 pf_per_revive_silk_road_desc: "A long time ago, Persia lay at the heart of a trade route stretching from China in the east to the Mediterranean in the west. Such trade routes have long since fell into disrepair, but now that our lands stretch so far along this old route, we should rebuild some of the old trading cities to boost our internal trade to new heights."
 pf_per_persian_prosperity_desc: "Today Persia is in an era of unprecedented wealth and prosperity. Our state is one of the richest in the world, our cities shine across the Persian heartland. Thanks to the Dastur, a new age of prosperity has fallen across all of Persia."
 pf_per_persuade_satrapies_desc: "The time has come for the Satrapies to lay down their resistance once and for all, and truly bow down to our Great Dastur. The Satrapies have experienced unprecedented prosperity under our rule, and it is time for them to accept that being a subject of Persia is not a burden, but a privilege."
 pf_per_modernize_the_government_desc: "Though our great governing system has been instrumental in allowing our vast conquests, there is still room for improvement. By instituting a set of reforms to include the most modern ideas into our government we can ensure it functions with the utmost efficiency."
 pf_per_complete_expansion_desc: "It seems like eons ago when our Dastur was subjected to the will of the Satrapies. They forced upon him an expansion plan that at the time seemed ludicrous. And yet, today, here we stand, with all that land and more under our almighty fist. What once seemed impossible is now reality. Our greatness knows no bounds. What next, my Dastur?"
 pf_per_persian_arquebus_desc: "With the reopening of some trade with the East our state has become one of the first to use gunpowder in weaponry. Our constant conflicts with the accursed Satraps has lead to several military reforms, and one such reform has been the training with and use of the Arquebus in combat. We should push this new edge we have gained on our enemies as soon as possible."
 pf_per_develop_siege_tech_desc: "When we used gunpowder to fire small pellets at our enemies, it turns out we simply weren't thinking big enough. It turns out if you get a lot more gunpowder and a much bigger bullet, you can achieve some truly great things."
 pf_per_recruit_from_satrapies_desc: "For too long the Satrapies have resisted our rule. The time has come to incorporate their troops into our armies. After all, is it not they who are benefitting the most from our vast conquests?"
 pf_per_raise_standing_army_desc: "As our state grows larger and our enemies band together in futile attempts to stop us, the need has arisen for a great Persian army. Our well-drilled and well-equipped troops dominate the battlefield, and soon none shall be able to resist the might of the Persian army."
 pf_per_unite_the_faith_desc: "It has long been clear that we are the center of the Zoroastrian world. But today, we are not just the center, but the entirety of it. All of the peoples of the true faith answer to us, indeed as they should. Now, all that is left is to convince the rest of the world of the truths we speak."
 pf_per_dominate_northern_india_desc: "With the north of India consolidated under our Satrapies there, its riches are available to the rest of our great nation. Indeed, as a mostly Zoroastrian region, the people there welcome our rule, free of the heresies that plagued them in years past."
 pf_per_expel_all_heresy_desc: "Our nation has the Zoroastrian faith embedded at its core. There is no place for heretics here. Today, we have proven that, with every single province of our vast lands professing the true faith. Today is a joyous day."
 pf_per_centralized_state_desc: "As our government modernises and the power of the Satraps has been all but removed, we are finally able to revoke one of the oldest rights they demanded of us. As of today, any Satrap is at our mercy, their titles may be taken at any time, their realm incorporated fully into ours. While the Satraps may continue to look over the borderlands, the heart of the Persian lands will finally fully be under our direct rule!"

 pf_persian_empire_a_persian_empire_desc: "With all pretenders to our claim destroyed, our direct control over the Persian homelands solidified and our administration more efficient and competent than ever before, the day has come to proclaim the Persian Empire! May the world tremble at our feet forever more!"
 pf_persian_empire_religious_question_desc: "The population of heathens under our rule grows by the day. With our latest conquests we now have a very sizable population of heathens under our rule and they are rather reluctant to convert to the True Faith. Thus, we must decide on how to deal with this problem, should we crush the heathens completely, or come to a more tolerant arrangement?"
