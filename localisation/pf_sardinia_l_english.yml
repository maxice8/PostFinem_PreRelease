SAR_ideas: "Sardinian Ideas"
SAR_ideas_start: "Sardinian Traditions"
SAR_ideas_bonus: "Sardinian Ambition"

sar_marines: "Sardinian Marine Corps"
sar_marines_desc: "Our people live and die by the sea. It is both a great wall surrounding us, and a fabulously wealthy field we can pick our crop from. For years, Sardinia has had a strong fishing culture, with many learned men experts in the art of seafare. As we turn our gaze abroad, we should establish a national Marine Corps to carry out overseas activities, made up of these veterans."
sar_republic: "The Seven Salesmen"
sar_republic_desc: "Legend tells of a group of seven men, fed up with the falling profits from fishing that proved too little to provide for their families, journeyed out into the Mediterranean to find new markets. Each man returned with from a different country with a different beneficial contract, and the Sardinian fishing industry was reignited once more, its connections now reaching further than ever. The traditions of these 'seven salesman' and the way they saved Sardinia have left a lasting impact on our culture and policy, ensuring government are always keen to establish mercantile ties where ever the opportunity arises."
sar_constitution: "The People's Constitution"
sar_constitution_desc: "The Sardinian League was proclaimed in 1438, at a grand meeting between representatives of the cities and families of the island in Arborea. There, they together wrote and ratified the People's Constitution, a document creating and guaranteeing a set of rights for the peoples of the League. This included basic freedoms like the right to free enterprise on the island, protection from piracy and illegal seizure abroad, and the right to have your claims heard in a court of law. With these provisions in place, we will ensure our Republic is built on a strong and stable foundation."
sar_trade_nexus: "Between Here and There"
sar_trade_nexus_desc: "The island of Sardinia grew rich on the trade that flowed from Italia to Carthage, acting as a stopping off point for merchants and sailors following the well-trodden seaways. As a result, our all-too-often isolated island was introduced to and flooded with all sorts of luxury goods, greatly expanding both the quality of our people's lives and the prestige of our garnments. In return, Sardinian merchants offered a taste of our speciality fish, which is still to this day eaten eagerly by famished seamen."
sar_national_zeal: "Allegiance to the Flag"
sar_national_zeal_desc: "Since the unification of Sardinia, a wave of nationalism has swept the island, catching all before it into the swelling tide of pride and patriotism. We should take advantage of this by investing in education, to instil the traditional Sardinian morals into our children, and in our foreign policy, by ensuring we are always taken seriously by our often arrogant neighbours."
sar_crossroads_of_cultures: "Crossroads of Cultures"
sar_crossroads_of_cultures_desc: "Situated in the middle of the great green sea, Sardinia has always been a crossroads of cultures. From the Nuragic peoples to the Iberians, the Phoenicians to the Latins, our people have encounted a great many faces and tongues. As a result, no one is surprised to hear a foreign tone, and every traveller is welcomed with open arms."
sar_mercantile_ambition: "Ordinances of Sassari"
sar_mercantile_ambition_desc: "The Ordinances of Sassari were introduced by the Sardinian Parliament to attempt to combat the problem of rampant piracy in the Mediterranean. It stipulated that every merchant must travel with a partner, who must not be separated from them at any time, so that every ship would be better equiped to avoid or fight off raiders and illicit dealers. This deal, though awkward for many merchants, who often find themselves without friends due to the exploitative nature of their business boiling over into their personal lives, helped to further ensure the safety of Sardinian merchants when travelling overseas."

pf_sar.1.t: "The Cagliari Marine Corps"
pf_sar.1.d: "The Sardinian marines are a core part of our military. Without them, we could not project our power across the waves nearly as effectively. As a result, any matters dealing with their affairs must be handled carefully as to not upset the delicate balance between us. Investment in barracks and training facilities in the town of Cagliari has resulted in new recruits flocking to the standards, eager to join and become one of the fabled Sardinian Reds. Such is the number of people joining the army, that a new regiment has been founded, the Cagliari Marine Corps. They will form the bulwark of our naval personel, and hopefully usher in a new era of maritime supremacy."
pf_sar.1.a: "Reform the Marine Corps."
pf_sar_cagliari_marine_corps: "Cagliari Marine Corps"

pf_sar.2.t: "Carbonian Silver Mines"
pf_sar.2.d: "Near the southern town of Carbonia, a vast deposit of silver has been found. The discovery has triggered a cascade of miners to make their way down to the settlement growing up around the site, each seeking their own fortunes. The state has moved in and claimed ownership over the site, giving us access to a portion of every chunk of silver ore mined there, transforming the area from a backwater hillside into a center for coin minting."
pf_sar.2.a: "Silver is the lifeblood of our economy."
pf_sar_carbonia_silver_mines: "Silver Mines of Carbonia"
desc_pf_sar_carbonia_silver_mines: "Vast deposits of silver have been found in the hillsides around Carbonia, supplying fresh bullion for both the locals and the state."

pf_sar.3.t: "A Work of Art"
pf_sar.3.d: "The new Parliament building is truly one of the greatest works of modern architecture, but it is still quite bare and insignificant inside. Many have suggested that we commission a new painting to be displayed in the halls of the representatives, following in the style of the decorations of many other European royal courts. This idea has picked up a lot of traction, and now the main question to be answered is how much we are willing to pay for it."
pf_sar.3.a: "So long as it is completed, we do not mind who makes it."
pf_sar.3.b: "Higher an artist to paint a family portrait."
pf_sar.3.c: "Only the finest artist of the age will do!"

 pf_sar_invade_sicily_desc:0 "Sicily is much like Sardinia, an island rich off of the trade routes that pass through it, settled firstly by the Carthaginians and Phoenicians. We share many similarities - but we are no way equals. Sicily is divided and often in conflict with itself, while Sardinia is strong and united by the League. Clearly the strongest will prevail, and rule over the Italian islands will be ours."

 pf_sar_the_twelve_laws_desc:0 "The League is governed by the Articles, a set of agreements drawn up with the initial founding treaty detailing how government should be carried out.

They must be cleared and the islands must be made safe for our traders."

 pf_sar_mare_nostrum_title:0 "Mare Nostrum"
 pf_sar_mare_nostrum_desc:0 "In ancient times, the Romans believed they controlled the sea. In their tongue, the 'mare nostrum' was simply an extension of Roman authority, surrounding the lands of all other lesser peoples. Their hubris got the better of them and their republic was shattered and scattered to the winds, and hegemony over the Mediterranean subsequently fell to Carthage. Carthage too, has felt the heat of the sun upon its wings. As that old city plumets towards the wicked waves, the Sardinian age is only just beginning."

 pf_sar_seize_corsica_title:0 "Seize Corsica"
