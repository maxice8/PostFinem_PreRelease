 pf_ath_lords_of_morea_desc:0 "Morea is practically an island, and certainly acts like it. In the past, the lords and princes of Morea were under our rulerships, but over the centuries they have gradually drifted towards independence, especially in the wake of the rise of Macedonia. We should seek to re-establish other authority over this potentially wealthy corner of southern Hellas."
