 pf_abn_white_cliffs_title:0 "White Cliffs Standing Tall"
 pf_abn_white_cliffs_desc:0 "Albion is named for the stunning white cliffs that flank our southern shoreline. The cliffs are the first thing many travellers and traders see when approaching our isles, a welcoming reminder of their presence in Albionic territory. Like the white cliffs, our many cities are great signs to the heavens and foreigners alike. As the population grows, urbanisation becomes ever more inevitable, and there are only so many people our ancient citadels can handle. We should expand the capacity of our cities, and ensure that they are built to survive the future, not just the present."
