 incident_eyl_wants_to_join_member_alert:0 "Under new leadership the Eyl pirates now seek inclusion in the Confederation. Famous for their ruthless efficiency, they have for long raided all along the Italian coast and the Mediterranean sea at large, in some cases even going so far as raiding cities in the mainland.\n\nThe evidence of their ruthless deeds remains etched in the pillaged provinces and shattered remnants of ports along the Italian coast, most notable of them being the Infamous sack of the capital of Roma in 1411, memorized by a tradition of all harbours directly under the city's control holding ritual sacrifices of captured pirates on the last day of every month to "ward off the most bloodthirsty of them".\n\nUnsuprisingly their path to integration is marked by a unconditional demand set forth by the members of the Confederation, especially the coastal trading cities. The Eyl pirates must unequivocally abandon their piratical legacy and adopt a new identity as a Mercantile Republic, mirroring the coastal trading cities that were once their targets. This demand reflects a cautious but optimistic sentiment among the Confederation's constituents, keen on safeguarding the stability of their maritime domains, and the profitability of their trade routes."

Led by new captains, we yearn to cast off our infamous mantle and forge a new path: integration into the very confederation we once plagued.\nHowever, the path to the Confederation demands sacrifice. To secure membership, we must abandon our pirate ways and embrace a new identity as a Republic of Traders, trading cutlasses for commerce, and piracy for prosperity."
