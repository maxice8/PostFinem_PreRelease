 ar_car_events.2.d: "Carthage has grown, and as we continue to reconquest the lands of our forebearers we must also consider an important question: what next?\nAfter we reclaim the lands held by our ancestors what shall we do? Do we set our sights back to our motherland, the lands of Canaan and Tyre? Or do we strike out and establish our own destiny, separate from our Phoenician heritage?\n\nRegardless of what we decide, the future holds many adventures."

 ar_car_events.4.t: "Importing Elephants for War"
 ar_car_events.4.d: "The tales of the legendary war elephants of ancient Carthage, striking fear into the hearts of every soldier that came within it's rampaging path, are still told to this day.\nSultans from the interior of the continent of Africa have sent emissaries to local governors proposing a business venture within our nation in which we lease our lands for herding rights, and receive a portion of the stock in exchange. Training these elephants for war could give us the edge we need to march fourth, and perhaps, cross the Alps once more and march toward Rome!"
 ar_car_events.4.a: "Let us begin right now!"
 
 ar_car_events.5.t: "A Revival of the Punic Pantheon"
 ar_car_events.5.d: "As Carthago grows many older ruins are uncovered many aspects of the Carthage of antiquity is uncovered, and we learn more about our heritage and where we came from. The ancient Canaanite belief system.\nAs our scholars delve deeper into the lore behind the Punic Pantheon, word is reaching local populations within our borders, and many have actually embraced the faith, proclaiming Tanit and Melqart as their chief dieties.\nAs the $MONARCHTITLE$ has the final say in administrative matters within Carthage, we must make a decision on the future of the Punic Pantheon. Shall we encourage it to flourish and enrich our culture, or shall we leave it to the anals of history and press fourth with our established [Root.Religion.GetName] faith?\nIf we should enforce a new faith on our constituents, we will likely meet some resistence, but nothing the military garrisons could not handle."
 ar_car_events.5.a: "Under Melqart's guidance we thrive!"
 ar_car_events.5.b: "We must stick to our roots."
