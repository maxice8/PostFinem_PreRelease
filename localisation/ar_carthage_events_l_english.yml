 pf_car.2.d: "The tales of the legendary war elephants of ancient Carthage, striking fear into the hearts of every soldier that came within it's rampaging path, are still told to this day.\nWarlords from the interior of the continent of Africa have sent emissaries to local governors proposing a business venture within our nation in which we lease our lands for herding rights, and receive a portion of the stock in exchange. Training these elephants for war could give us the edge we need to march fourth, and perhaps, cross the Alps once more and march toward Rome!"
