 pf_pol_events.1.t: "A Kingdom in Twain"
 pf_pol_events.1.d: "The Kingdom of Lechia was once a great power in the center of Europe, with its cities prosperous and it's politics stable. However, after the reign of Miroslav Lazarevic in the 13th century, that fell apart. The kingdom entered a steady decline, until the succession of Ignacij Lazarevic in 1431. His brother, Caspar, was wanting for the throne their entire life, and on that day he took it. In the chaos and civil war that ensued Caspar was exiled to the west, seizing some land in the region around Krakow and ruling there until this day, slowly plotting his return"
