 pf_trn.1.t: "The Future of the Confederation"
 pf_trn.1.desc: "With the passing of our last great chief, the Confederation has been sent into a period of mourning. Destiny does not wait for our grief however - we must make the solemn task of electing a successor our top priority, else disorder and strife may engulf the realm. Each of the Five Tribes has elected a candidate from their houses, leaving it only up the the Council of Elders to decide who is most worthy."
 pf_trn.1.a: "The Trinovantes' candidate excites us most."
 pf_trn.1.b: "The ambition of the Iceni candidate is tempting."
 pf_trn.1.c: "The Cantiaci candidate demonstrates great skill."
 pf_trn.1.d: "The Catuvellauni may yet unite the realm."
 pf_trn.1.e: "The knowledge of the Regni candidate is desirable."
 pf_trn.1.f: "Let the strongest win!"

pf_trn.2.t: "Peace and Cooperation"
pf_trn.2.d: "Recent times have been kind to our Confederation, and bestowed upon us the most bountiful harvests and forgiving climate. Even the internal competitions between the tribes seem to have subsided, leaving our alliance stronger than ever both inside and out. Tribal leaders are quick to come to the negotiating oak rather than to clench their swords at the first sign of trouble; the humble farmer does not complain for lack of grain, but rather smiles as he looks over his plentiful herds; the sky itself grins as it looks upon the beauty of our nation."
pf_trn.2.a: "Life is bliss!"
pf_trn.2.b: "There must be more tribute to be taken then!"
pf_trn.2.c: "This is testament to our benevolent policies."

pf_trn.3.t: "A Trial of Swords and Clubs"
pf_trn.3.d: "Tensions ran high as a fierce competition unfolded between the [Root.GetPrimaryTribe] and [Root.GetSecondaryTribe] tribes, threatening to escalate into violence. What began as a spirited contest to assert dominance over a fertile border region had spiralled into a dangerous rivalry. Both tribes, fiercely proud of their heritage, vied for control of valuable farmland and trade routes, their chieftains stoking the flames of competition. Verbal disputes turned into skirmishes, and there were whispers of alliances being forged with neighboring tribes. The fragile peace of the Confederation hung in the balance, awaiting a resolution that might either solidify their enmity or offer a path towards reconciliation and cooperation."
pf_trn.3.a: "Favour the [Root.GetPrimaryTribe]"
pf_trn.3.b: "Favour the [Root.GetSecondaryTribe]"
pf_trn.3.c: "Let them sort it out amongst themselves."
pf_trn.3.dd: "Resolve the dispute in a court of law."

pf_trn.4.t: "The Many Paths of War"
pf_trn.4.d: "Within the Confederation's council chamber, a bitter conflict raged between two prominent tribes, each advocating a different approach to manage the ongoing war. The [Root.GetPrimaryTribe], known for their fierce warriors, clamored for an aggressive, offensive strategy, believing that seizing the initiative would secure victory swiftly. In contrast, the [Root.GetSecondaryTribe], renowned for their diplomatic finesse, argued for a more cautious, diplomatic route, advocating for negotiations and alliances with neighboring nations to avoid further bloodshed. Tensions escalated as each faction staunchly defended their stance, threatening to fracture the unity of the Confederation just when it was needed most on the battlefield. The stakes were high, and the decision they made would determine not only the course of the war but the very future of the Confederation itself."
pf_trn.4.a: "The [Root.GetPrimaryTribe]'s plan seems promising..."
pf_trn.4.b: "... but I like the ideas of the [Root.GetSecondaryTribe] better."
pf_trn.4.c: "The Council will decide its own course in war!"
pf_trn.4.dd: "There is no time for fighting amongst ourselves, there is glory to be won!"

pf_trn.5.t: "The Disgraced Chief"
pf_trn.5.d: "In a solemn gathering of the Council of Elders, the chief of one of the Confederation's tribes faced a grave judgment. Accused of betraying the trust of the alliance by forging secret alliances with an enemy faction, the chief was found guilty after hours of deliberation. The room, heavy with tension, echoed with the weight of the verdict. The elders' decision, delivered with a heavy heart, stripped the chief of leadership and cast a shadow over the once-respected figure. It was a somber reminder that even the most powerful must answer for their actions, and the Confederation's unity stood above individual ambition."
pf_trn.5.a: "Respect the decision of the Council."
pf_trn.5.b: "This man was wrongfully convicted!"
pf_trn.5.c: "We will make sure he has a plentiful retirement."

pf_trn.6.t: "Searching the Stars"
pf_trn.6.d: "The court of the Confederacy beckoned the skilled astrologer to its grand observatory, seeking his wisdom and foresight among the celestial tapestry. With eyes fixed upon the heavens, the astrologer meticulously charted the movements of stars and planets. He delved into the ancient scrolls, seeking patterns and deciphering cryptic alignments that might unveil the kingdom's destiny. The weight of high expectations hung heavy as he scanned the cosmos for portents, searching for answers in the distant constellations, hoping to reveal prophecies hidden among the celestial wonders above."
pf_trn.6.a: "What secrets do the heavens hold?"
pf_trn_searching_the_stars_tt: "The astrologer will search the skies for omens for the next year."

pf_trn.7.t: "Good Omens"
pf_trn.7.d: "After a year of studying the stars for omens about the future of the Confederation, our astrologer has reported back to the Council with his findings. He says he observed various remarkable celestial events, including astounding planetary alignments and stars that grow and shrink in brightness. From this evidence has come up with a conclusion - there are good omens from above. The heavens predict power will come to the Confederation to the detriment of our enemies, bringing about a new era of hope and glory for all Britons."
pf_trn.7.a: "What marvellous news!"

pf_trn.8.t: "A Man of Other Worlds"
pf_trn.8.d: "TBD"
pf_trn.8.a: "Invite the nations that most benefited from his truce."
pf_trn.8.b: "Give him a warrior's funeral in Brittonic style."

pf_trn.9.d: "TBD"
pf_trn.9.a: "Attend the funeral."
pf_trn.9.b: "We are glad he is dead!"

pf_trn.10.t: "Assistance from the Druids"
pf_trn.10.d: "With our willingness to give them what they want proven, the Druids of the realm have come together and elected representatives to meet with the Council. Anxious to keep their new privileges and lands, they may be willing to offer their support in the upcoming war with the down-trodden subject Britons. In what area do we require the most assistance?"
pf_trn.10.a: "Request their assistance in rallying the people for war."
pf_trn.10.b: "Let them serve in the administration to ease the burden of war."
pf_trn.10.c: "They should focus on the spiritual conflict fought simultaneously."
pf_trn.10.dd: "I do not need their help."
pf_trn_no_druid_support_reward_tt: "If we successfully defeat the §YCeltic Tyranny§! without the help of the Druids, we will gain extra bonuses from the associated mission."

pf_trn_druid_help_3: "Druid War Support"

pf_trn.11.t: "The Celtic Tyranny"
pf_trn.11.d: "Long ago, the peoples of Albion lived in harmony. Wars and petty tribal conflicts had plagued the island for centuries, but peace had at last arrived on its sightly golden chariot. Old grudges were set aside, and agreement of mutual defence were made. Peoples who had for centuries lived in competition with one another now lived in bliss.\n\nEverything changed when the Gaels attacked. They entered these isles just like their ancestors did - accompanied by hoards of bowmen and savage thugs. This time, however, they had not come just to raid - they had come to conquer. The tribes of Celtica had been united by force only a few years prior, creating a new power in the region with resources and warriors in amounts no other tribe had seen before. They turned this new war machine against our fair island, and laid siege to its extremeties.\n\nThe peoples of the north stood no chance - too busy with their own squabbling, the Pictish tribes fell one by one. The people of north and south Cymry too, divided they fell. In the east, where the most ancient of the tribes of the Celtic Isles dwelt, that peaceful orchard among a flaming forest, they felt the harded resistance. Despite the best efforts of the alliances of bold and mighty kings and their druids, much of Albion was placed under the boot of Celtica and set ablaze. Facing certain doom otherwise, the tribes of the far east, known to history as the Oaken Five, formed a confederation between their leaderships, and placed their combined armies at the whim of a joint Council of Elders. They successfully mounted a defence of the frontiers along the Thames river, and scored a decisive victory at the battle of Camulodunon, forcing the Gaelic dragon out of Confederate lands.\n\nIn the years since this victory, the Confederation has prospered through mutual cooperation and the sharing of resources, maintaining its independence even as the new threat of Nordic invaders loomed on the horizon. In contrast, the subjugated Britons, now forced to pay yearly tribute to the Lord of Celtica, wallowed in their misery with each passing season. Their wifes were taken, their leaders executed, and now even their harvests were not fully theirs. While at night they dreamed of independence, by day the served like a faithful hound before its master. The Confederation is the last hope for these down-trodden people. By force of might, we must overthrow this Celtic Tyranny and liberate our brothers and sisters!"
pf_trn.11.a: "Now we just need a plan!"
pf_trn_celtic_tyranny_tt: "The ambitions of the younger chiefs grow, while the elders still play their games of truces and diplomacy..."

pf_trn.12.t: "Like Mother, Like Daughter"
pf_trn.12.d: "The Daughters of Boudicca have performed well for us on the battlefield, scoring many key victories and greatly assisting our efforts to put down rebellions. For their service, they have been rewarded handsomely with shares of the war booty and extra payment upon their return to their villages. Such is the extent of their success, however, that many in our military establishment long for them to be a formal part of the growing Confederate Army. We could then use their skills whenever we need, and at potentially much lower prices. On the other hand, there are many, particularly amongst the Daughters themselves, that they should retain their independence, running through the wilds with sword in hand beholden to know government without a contract. What will be their future?"
pf_trn.12.a: "Integrate them into our standing army."
pf_trn.12.b: "Let the Daughters retain their freedom."
pf_trn_future_of_the_daughters_1_tt: "§RWe will no longer be able to hire the §YDaughters of Boudicca§!.§!"

pf_trn_integrate_daughters_of_boudicca: "The Daughters of Boudicca Regiment"

pf_trn.13.t: "The Magic of the Druids"
pf_trn.13.d: "The druids have always been associated with magic and mystic actions. From their earliest days, they were said to be able to cast spells that would create a 'fence of protection' around armies, raise ferocious storms to hinder invading armies, and predict the future with remarkable accuracy. Most of these powers are now thought to be little more than myths created by our excited ancestors. While the druids certainly have profound influence with the gods and nature, they are no more wizards than the rest of us. A few old folk hang on to these beliefs however, and swear they saw their long dead relatives practices benign magic. This is clearly nothing but baseless superstition, but there is a certain part of the mind of every one of us that wants it to be true..."
pf_trn.13.a: "We must look to the future, not to the past."
pf_trn.13.b: "Our traditions mean more than anything to us."
pf_trn_will_influence_future_missions_tt: "§OChoosing this option will influence our future missions.§!"

pf_trn_looking_to_the_past: "Looking to the Past"

pf_trn.14.t: "The Thirteen Treasures of Albion"
pf_trn.14.d: "Legends tell of a collection of artefacts known as the 'Thirteen Treasures of Albion'. The objects are the subjects of many myths, and are encountered in a vast array of tales about great heroes of old from across the Brittonic world. Several notable items include the Hamper of Gwyddno Garanhir, which when food was placed within it, would return it a hundred-fold; the Whetstone of Tudwal Tudglyd, which when a brave man sharpened his sword on it, would guarantee the death of any man cut by that sword; and the Mantle of Arthur, which would grant invisibility to those under it, while still being able to see normally themselves. Whether or not these treasures are real is debatable, but they are certainly an important part of our cultural history. Without the shrewd work of poets and bards, these stories would be lost to time."
pf_trn.14.a: "Wonderful."

While we may have succeeded in stopping them from conquering us in the short term, our long term survival looks ever more shaky.

Behind their mud houses and wooden walls, they believe themselves safe. We must construct a new fleet, one brave enough to weather the stormiest seas, to land our brave men and women on the shores of Gaelland and bring down their empire once and for all."

pf_trn_the_folk_council_desc: "The Council of Elders has held supreme power over the Confederation for too long. It was their indecisive and passive nature that led to Celtica taking over as much land as it did, a situation that was only rectified when the common people of the realm stepped forward for service. Like the winds, the times are changing. Let us reduce the Council of Elders to a more ceremonial position, and create a new 'Folk Council' made up of free commonfolk to debate and introduce laws and policies."

pf_trn_the_oaken_five_desc: "Long ago, the five most powerful tribes of the east, the Trinovantes, the Iceni, the Regni, the Cantiaci, and the Catuvellauni, came together and signed a treaty of eternal cooperation. Their leaders met underneath a great oak tree on the outskirts of Uenta Icenorum, giving the alliance its informal name - the Oaken Five.

Spurred on by the mistreatment of her and her daughters by the invasive Trinovantes after the death of her husband, Boudicca led a campaign of conquest and revenge that took her across Albion, establishing Iceni dominion where ever she went. While her empire collapsed quickly after her death, the tales of her deeds are yet to die - many generations of Iceni warriors have looked to her as the guiding hand behind their victories, with some even offering sacrifices to appease her still-living spirit. A group of women, who would traditionally have been reserved for domestic life, known as the 'Daughters of Boudicca', claim to be her descendants, and continue to practice her battle techniques and preach of her righteous conquest. The Daughters are some of the most well trained and skilled fighters in all the land - let us offer them some money for their service."
