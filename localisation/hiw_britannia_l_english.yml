 brittonic_confederation_reform: "Brittonic Confederation"
 brittonic_confederation_reform_desc: "Long ago, our way of life came under threat. The Gaels of Ireland encroached ever deeper into deer Prydain from the west, while the vile Norse marauders harass us from the north and east. The tribes of the east were forced to come together, to put aside their differences, and unite their forces into one Confederation. Aimed at mutual self-defence and eventually dismantling their enemies, the Confederation relies on its internal cohesion to maintain proper operations."

Their role is becoming more and more ceremonial however, as bold young leaders take to the stage, taking the Confederation on a new path towards glory. We must preserve the institution of the Council of Elders, but make them act as more an advisory committee rather than a government body."

 pf_trn.1.t: "The Future of the Confederation"
 pf_trn.1.desc: "With the passing of our last great chief, the Confederation has been sent into a period of mourning. Destiny does not wait for our grief however - we must make the solemn task of electing a successor our top priority, else disorder and strife may engulf the realm. Each of the Five Tribes has elected a candidate from their houses, leaving it only up the the Council of Elders to decide who is most worthy."
 pf_trn.1.a: "The Trinovantes' candidate excites us most."
 pf_trn.1.b: "The ambition of the Iceni candidate is tempting."
 pf_trn.1.c: "The Cantiaci candidate demonstrates great skill."
 pf_trn.1.d: "The Catuvellauni may yet unite the realm."
 pf_trn.1.e: "The knowledge of the Regni candidate is desirable."
 pf_trn.1.f: "Let the strongest win!"

pf_trn.2.t: "Peace and Cooperation"
pf_trn.2.d: "Recent times have been kind to our Confederation, and bestowed upon us the most bountiful harvests and forgiving climate. Even the internal competitions between the tribes seem to have subsided, leaving our alliance stronger than ever both inside and out. Tribal leaders are quick to come to the negotiating oak rather than to clench their swords at the first sign of trouble; the humble farmer does not complain for lack of grain, but rather smiles as he looks over his plentiful herds; the sky itself grins as it looks upon the beauty of our nation."
pf_trn.2.a: "Life is bliss!"
pf_trn.2.b: "There must be more tribute to be taken then!"
pf_trn.2.c: "This is testament to our benevolent policies."

pf_trn.3.t: "A Trial of Swords and Clubs"
pf_trn.3.d: "Tensions ran high as a fierce competition unfolded between the [Root.GetPrimaryTribe] and [Root.GetSecondaryTribe] tribes, threatening to escalate into violence. What began as a spirited contest to assert dominance over a fertile border region had spiralled into a dangerous rivalry. Both tribes, fiercely proud of their heritage, vied for control of valuable farmland and trade routes, their chieftains stoking the flames of competition. Verbal disputes turned into skirmishes, and there were whispers of alliances being forged with neighboring tribes. The fragile peace of the Confederation hung in the balance, awaiting a resolution that might either solidify their enmity or offer a path towards reconciliation and cooperation."
pf_trn.3.a: "Favour the [Root.GetPrimaryTribe]"
pf_trn.3.b: "Favour the [Root.GetSecondaryTribe]"
pf_trn.3.c: "Let them sort it out amongst themselves."
pf_trn.3.dd: "Resolve the dispute in a court of law."

pf_trn.4.t: "The Many Paths of War"
pf_trn.4.d: "Within the Confederation's council chamber, a bitter conflict raged between two prominent tribes, each advocating a different approach to manage the ongoing war. The [Root.GetPrimaryTribe], known for their fierce warriors, clamored for an aggressive, offensive strategy, believing that seizing the initiative would secure victory swiftly. In contrast, the [Root.GetSecondaryTribe], renowned for their diplomatic finesse, argued for a more cautious, diplomatic route, advocating for negotiations and alliances with neighboring nations to avoid further bloodshed. Tensions escalated as each faction staunchly defended their stance, threatening to fracture the unity of the Confederation just when it was needed most on the battlefield. The stakes were high, and the decision they made would determine not only the course of the war but the very future of the Confederation itself."
pf_trn.4.a: "The [Root.GetPrimaryTribe]'s plan seems promising..."
pf_trn.4.b: "... but I like the ideas of the [Root.GetSecondaryTribe] better."
pf_trn.4.c: "The Council will decide its own course in war!"
pf_trn.4.dd: "There is no time for fighting amongst ourselves, there is glory to be won!"

pf_trn.5.t: "The Disgraced Chief"
pf_trn.5.d: "In a solemn gathering of the Council of Elders, the chief of one of the Confederation's tribes faced a grave judgment. Accused of betraying the trust of the alliance by forging secret alliances with an enemy faction, the chief was found guilty after hours of deliberation. The room, heavy with tension, echoed with the weight of the verdict. The elders' decision, delivered with a heavy heart, stripped the chief of leadership and cast a shadow over the once-respected figure. It was a somber reminder that even the most powerful must answer for their actions, and the Confederation's unity stood above individual ambition."
pf_trn.5.a: "Respect the decision of the Council."
pf_trn.5.b: "This man was wrongfully convicted!"
pf_trn.5.c: "We will make sure he has a plentiful retirement."

pf_trn.6.t: "Searching the Stars"
pf_trn.6.d: "The court of the Confederacy beckoned the skilled astrologer to its grand observatory, seeking his wisdom and foresight among the celestial tapestry. With eyes fixed upon the heavens, the astrologer meticulously charted the movements of stars and planets. He delved into the ancient scrolls, seeking patterns and deciphering cryptic alignments that might unveil the kingdom's destiny. The weight of high expectations hung heavy as he scanned the cosmos for portents, searching for answers in the distant constellations, hoping to reveal prophecies hidden among the celestial wonders above."
pf_trn.6.a: "What secrets do the heavens hold?"
pf_trn_searching_the_stars_tt: "The astrologer will search the skies for omens for the next year."

pf_trn.7.t: "Good Omens"
pf_trn.7.d: "After a year of studying the stars for omens about the future of the Confederation, our astrologer has reported back to the Council with his findings. He says he observed various remarkable celestial events, including astounding planetary alignments and stars that grow and shrink in brightness. From this evidence has come up with a conclusion - there are good omens from above. The heavens predict power will come to the Confederation to the detriment of our enemies, bringing about a new era of hope and glory for all Britons."
pf_trn.7.a: "What marvellous news!"

pf_trn.8.t: "A Man of Other Worlds"
pf_trn.8.d: "TBD"
pf_trn.8.a: "Invite the nations that most benefited from his truce."
pf_trn.8.b: "Give him a warrior's funeral in Brittonic style."

pf_trn.9.t: "The Death of Ricatus 'the Shield'"
pf_trn.9.d: "TBD"
pf_trn.9.a: "Attend the funeral."
pf_trn.9.b: "We are glad he is dead!"

pf_trn.10.t: "Assistance from the Druids"
pf_trn.10.d: "With our willingness to give them what they want proven, the Druids of the realm have come together and elected representatives to meet with the Council. Anxious to keep their new privileges and lands, they may be willing to offer their support in the upcoming war with the down-trodden subject Britons. In what area do we require the most assistance?"
pf_trn.10.a: "Request their assistance in rallying the people for war."
pf_trn.10.b: "Let them serve in the administration to ease the burden of war."
pf_trn.10.c: "They should focus on the spiritual conflict fought simultaneously."
pf_trn.10.dd: "I do not need their help."
pf_trn_no_druid_support_reward_tt: "If we successfully defeat the §YCeltic Tyranny§! without the help of the Druids, we will gain extra bonuses from the associated mission."

pf_trn_astrology_title: "Signs in the Stars"
pf_trn_astrology_desc: "The future of the Confederation is uncertain, with many fearing the ever-growing cancers of the Celtic Lordship or the vile Northmen will overcome our walls and destroy us. In these times, the people need strong leadership, guidance, and most importantly, hope. Let us turn to the stars, to see if any omens or prophecies can be decoded from them that might light the fires of national spirit."

They could always be more help to us, however, if we can convince them."

pf_trn_build_army_desc: "With a revolution ongoing within the Council, it is more important than ever that we act quickly to secure our nation's interests.

pf_trn_ricatus_legacy_desc: "Ricatus was a great leader of the Confederation. He led our country on the path of peace and diplomacy, securing relations with our neighbours and organising effective truces. Many just a few decades prior had feared we would be overrun by now, but thanks to the hard work and dedication of Ricatus, those worries proved unfounded. With his passing however, a shadow has fallen over the Confederation. The peace he built may prove to be a glass cannon, and upon the moment of his death we can already feel the hounds sniffing for blood. Ricatus only dreamed of a strong and independent Confederation - his successors dream of Empire."

pf_trn_a_new_outlook_title: "A New Outlook"
pf_trn_a_new_outlook_desc: "The age of diplomacy is over. With Ricatus gone, there is no one left to limit our military potential. The time has come to prepare for war - war with the barbaric Gaels, who have for too long slept peacefully in their ivory towers while Albion pays liberal tribute. In order to prepare for this conflict, we must ensure our own flank is secure - the site of the old hill fort of Cair Grauth has been chosen to be strengthened, preventing an enemy from marching across the flanks of the great marshes to strike at our heartland."
