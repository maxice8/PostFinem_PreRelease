brittonic_confederation_reform: "Brittonic Confederation"
brittonic_confederation_reform_desc: "Long ago, our way of life came under threat. The Gaels of Ireland encroached ever deeper into deer Prydain from the west, while the vile Norse marauders harass us from the north and east. The tribes of the east were forced to come together, to put aside their differences, and unite their forces into one Confederation. Aimed at mutual self-defence and eventually dismantling their enemies, the Confederation relies on its internal cohesion to maintain proper operations."

CHIEFTESS: "Chieftess"

pf_trn.1.t: "The Future of the Confederation"
pf_trn.1.desc: "With the passing of our last great chief, the Confederation has been sent into a period of mourning. Destiny does not wait for our grief however - we must make the solemn task of electing a successor our top priority, else disorder and strife may engulf the realm. Each of the Five Tribes has elected a candidate from their houses, leaving it only up the the Council of Elders to decide who is most worthy."
pf_trn.1.a: "The Trinovantes' candidate excites us most."
pf_trn.1.b: "The ambition of the Iceni candidate is tempting."
pf_trn.1.c: "The Cantiaci candidate demonstrates great skill."
pf_trn.1.d: "The Catuvellauni may yet unite the realm."
pf_trn.1.e: "The knowledge of the Regni candidate is desirable."
pf_trn.1.f: "Let the strongest win!"
