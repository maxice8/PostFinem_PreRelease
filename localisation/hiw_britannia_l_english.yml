brittonic_confederation_reform_desc: "Long ago, our way of life came under threat. The Gaels of Ireland encroached ever deeper into deer Prydain from the west, while the vile Norse marauders harass us from the north and east. The tribes of the east were forced to come together, to put aside their differences, and unite their forces into one Confederation. Aimed at mutual self-defence and eventually dismantling their enemies, the Confederation relies on its internal cohesion to maintain proper operations."
