 brittonic_confederation_reform: "Brittonic Confederation"
 brittonic_confederation_reform_desc: "Long ago, our way of life came under threat. The Gaels of Ireland encroached ever deeper into deer Prydain from the west, while the vile Norse marauders harass us from the north and east. The tribes of the east were forced to come together, to put aside their differences, and unite their forces into one Confederation. Aimed at mutual self-defence and eventually dismantling their enemies, the Confederation relies on its internal cohesion to maintain proper operations."

pf_guidance_of_the_elders_reform_desc:0 "For centuries the elders of the tribes have held administrative power, controlling the actions of the group and acting as leaders when the time for war comes. Their role is becoming more and more ceremonial however, as bold young leaders take to the stage, taking the Confederation on a new path towards glory. We must preserve the institution of the Council of Elders, but make them act as more an advisory committee rather than a government body."

 pf_trn.1.t: "The Future of the Confederation"
 pf_trn.1.desc: "With the passing of our last great chief, the Confederation has been sent into a period of mourning. Destiny does not wait for our grief however - we must make the solemn task of electing a successor our top priority, else disorder and strife may engulf the realm. Each of the Five Tribes has elected a candidate from their houses, leaving it only up the the Council of Elders to decide who is most worthy."
 pf_trn.1.a: "The Trinovantes' candidate excites us most."
 pf_trn.1.b: "The ambition of the Iceni candidate is tempting."
 pf_trn.1.c: "The Cantiaci candidate demonstrates great skill."
 pf_trn.1.d: "The Catuvellauni may yet unite the realm."
 pf_trn.1.e: "The knowledge of the Regni candidate is desirable."
 pf_trn.1.f: "Let the strongest win!"

pf_trn.2.t: "Peace and Cooperation"
pf_trn.2.d: "Recent times have been kind to our Confederation, and bestowed upon us the most bountiful harvests and forgiving climate. Even the internal competitions between the tribes seem to have subsided, leaving our alliance stronger than ever both inside and out. Tribal leaders are quick to come to the negotiating oak rather than to clench their swords at the first sign of trouble; the humble farmer does not complain for lack of grain, but rather smiles as he looks over his plentiful herds; the sky itself grins as it looks upon the beauty of our nation."
pf_trn.2.a: "Life is bliss!"
pf_trn.2.b: "There must be more tribute to be taken then!"
pf_trn.2.c: "This is testament to our benevolent policies."

pf_trn.3.t: "A Trial of Swords and Clubs"
pf_trn.3.d: "Tensions ran high as a fierce competition unfolded between the [Root.GetPrimaryTribe] and [Root.GetSecondaryTribe] tribes, threatening to escalate into violence. What began as a spirited contest to assert dominance over a fertile border region had spiraled into a dangerous rivalry. Both tribes, fiercely proud of their heritage, vied for control of valuable farmland and trade routes, their chieftains stoking the flames of competition. Verbal disputes turned into skirmishes, and there were whispers of alliances being forged with neighboring tribes. The fragile peace of the Confederation hung in the balance, awaiting a resolution that might either solidify their enmity or offer a path towards reconciliation and cooperation."
pf_trn.3.a: "Favour the [Root.GetPrimaryTribe]"
pf_trn.3.b: "Favour the [Root.GetSecondaryTribe]"
pf_trn.3.c: "Let them sort it out amongst themselves."
pf_trn.3.dd: "Resolve the dispute in a court of law."
