 brittonic_confederation_reform: "Brittonic Confederation"
 brittonic_confederation_reform_desc: "Long ago, our way of life came under threat. The Gaels of Ireland encroached ever deeper into dear Prydain from the west, while the vile Norse marauders harass us from the north and east. The tribes of the east were forced to come together, to put aside their differences, and unite their forces into one Confederation. Aimed at mutual self-defence and eventually dismantling their enemies, the Confederation relies on its internal cohesion to maintain proper operations."

ability_trinovantes_cohesion_mechanic: "Cohesion"
ability_trinovantes_cohesion_mechanic_desc: "Managing the separate ambitions and demands of the constituent tribes of the Confederation can be difficult and requires an immense amount of skill and patience. Cohesion represents that ability, with higher levels signifying a more stable and productive alliance, and negative values indicating a state of general collapse.\n\nCohesion can be §Gincreased§! by:\n - Positive stability\n - Legitimacy\n - Power Projection\n - Monarch Skills\n\nCohesion can be §Rdecreased§! by:\n - Negative stability\n - War exhaustion\n - Corruption\n - Average Autonomy\n - Being over governing capacity\n"

 pf_clan_supremacy_reform_desc:0 "The old system of the Oaken Five has not worked in the long term. The time has come to formalise the rule of one tribe over all others, fitting in with the general trend of absolutism in Europe."

pf_guidance_of_the_elders_reform_desc:0 "For centuries the elders of the tribes have held administrative power, controlling the actions of the group and acting as leaders when the time for war comes. Their role is becoming more and more ceremonial however, as bold young leaders take to the stage, taking the Confederation on a new path towards glory. We must preserve the institution of the Council of Elders, but make them act as more an advisory committee rather than a government body."

Over the years, considerable centralisation has occured and what were once a hundred independent bands have consolidated down into confederations like our own.

Their spells and rituals kept us safe from enemies and increased our chances at success in battle. Nowadays, we are moving towards a more scientific world, and have begun to see the deeds of the druids as what they truly were - military tactics.

 trn_confederate_politics: "Confederate Politics"
 trn_confederate_politics_desc: "Managing the Confederation is a difficult practice - one must ensure that the needs of all the tribes are met, but never to excess or the detriment of the others. Every policy and law is a balancing act between a hundred different interest groups."
 trn_legendary_heroes: "A Storied Land of Heroes"
 trn_legendary_heroes_desc: "Albion is a land of many stories and heroes, with every region having its own diverse traditions and epic poetry. The east is no different - our heroes are more ancient than those of the Hen Ogledd, but they are nonetheless still relevant to the everyday traditions of the tribes."
 trn_collectivist_food: "Farms and Fields"
 trn_collectivist_food_desc: "The east of Albion is famed for its fertile lands and vast open fields. This land of plenty brings great riches to each of the tribes that inhabit it, and ensures steady amounts of tribute can be spared to the Council of Elders."
 trn_treaty_of_the_oak: "Treaty of the Oak"
 trn_treaty_of_the_oak_desc: "Faced with the threat of Celtic invasion and raids from the Northmen, the 'Oaken Five' tribes of the east came together to create a Confederation of mutual defence. Under the terms of the 'Treaty of the Oak', every tribe must support each other in time of conflict and a portion of their collective resources are pooled to be used for the common good by the Council of Elders."
 trn_unified_identity: "Uniting the Sheepfold"
 trn_unified_identity_desc: "The Confederation is a rare site of safety within the turbulent world. It is our duty to spread the peace and prosperity we have created for ourselves to the rest of Albion, and unite that great sheepfold under one flag."
 trn_red_moon_band: "Warriors and Warlocks"
 trn_red_moon_band_desc: "Albion is a land as steeped in blood as it is in history. Many great conquerors have risen and fallen, tyrants have committed atrocities that would pale the faces of our Carthaginian visitors, and countless men, women and children now lie in mass graves, victims of sport rather than necessity. Throughout the ages, our people have learned to fight and to fight well at that, because every moment is a battle in itself."
 trn_reconnect_north_sea_trade: "Revitalisation of the North Sea Trades"
 trn_reconnect_north_sea_trade_desc: "The North Sea was once a hub of trade in northern Europe, unrivalled by any nexus outside of the Mediterranean. Recent times have been hard however, and in the face of a changing climate, increasing Norse raids, and general instability in the Celtic Isles and on the continent, most of that once lucrative trade has slumped away into the shadows of history. Our policies to bring peace to Albion have achieved great things already - perhaps we could even succeed in restoring wealth to the North Sea?"

Sitting at the far west of Europe, Albion is a bastion at the edge of the world, a great white wall against the expanse of unknown beyond. Our empire is just beginning - with the Brittonic peoples united, there is nothing we cannot do together. We are no long content merely guarding the frontier - we seek to conquer and proclaim an empire for ourselves on the continent. All our enemies will be blinded before the brilliant light of the white sunrise."

abn_secular_state_desc: "The empire of Albion is a diverse place, with many settlements being full of foreigners, each speaking a different language and preaching a different faith. To combat any disunity before it arose, the Grand Council of Albion convened a set of Rites, which were then signed in Caerlyndon, protecting people of every religion from religious discrimination within Albionic territories."

abn_caledfwlch_order: "Order of Caledfwlch"
abn_caledfwlch_order_desc: "Caledfwlch was the legendary sword of the famous Arthur, a Brittonic warlord who fought back invasions from Germania many hundreds of years ago.

 pf_trn.1.t: "The Future of the Confederation"
 pf_trn.1.desc: "With the passing of our last great chief, the Confederation has been sent into a period of mourning. Destiny does not wait for our grief however - we must make the solemn task of electing a successor our top priority, else disorder and strife may engulf the realm. Each of the Five Tribes has elected a candidate from their houses, leaving it only up the the Council of Elders to decide who is most worthy."
 pf_trn.1.a: "The Trinovantes' candidate excites us most."
 pf_trn.1.b: "The ambition of the Iceni candidate is tempting."
 pf_trn.1.c: "The Cantiaci candidate demonstrates great skill."
 pf_trn.1.d: "The Catuvellauni may yet unite the realm."
 pf_trn.1.e: "The knowledge of the Regni candidate is desirable."
 pf_trn.1.f: "Let the strongest win!"

pf_trn.2.t: "Peace and Cooperation"
pf_trn.2.d: "Recent times have been kind to our Confederation, and bestowed upon us the most bountiful harvests and forgiving climate. Even the internal competitions between the tribes seem to have subsided, leaving our alliance stronger than ever both inside and out. Tribal leaders are quick to come to the negotiating oak rather than to clench their swords at the first sign of trouble; the humble farmer does not complain for lack of grain, but rather smiles as he looks over his plentiful herds; the sky itself grins as it looks upon the beauty of our nation."
pf_trn.2.a: "Life is bliss!"
pf_trn.2.b: "There must be more tribute to be taken then!"
pf_trn.2.c: "This is testament to our benevolent policies."

pf_trn.3.t: "A Trial of Swords and Clubs"
pf_trn.3.d: "Tensions ran high as a fierce competition unfolded between the [Root.GetPrimaryTribe] and [Root.GetSecondaryTribe] tribes, threatening to escalate into violence. What began as a spirited contest to assert dominance over a fertile border region had spiralled into a dangerous rivalry. Both tribes, fiercely proud of their heritage, vied for control of valuable farmland and trade routes, their chieftains stoking the flames of competition. Verbal disputes turned into skirmishes, and there were whispers of alliances being forged with neighboring tribes. The fragile peace of the Confederation hung in the balance, awaiting a resolution that might either solidify their enmity or offer a path towards reconciliation and cooperation."
pf_trn.3.a: "Favour the [Root.GetPrimaryTribe]"
pf_trn.3.b: "Favour the [Root.GetSecondaryTribe]"
pf_trn.3.c: "Let them sort it out amongst themselves."
pf_trn.3.dd: "Resolve the dispute in a court of law."

pf_trn.4.t: "The Many Paths of War"
pf_trn.4.d: "Within the Confederation's council chamber, a bitter conflict raged between two prominent tribes, each advocating a different approach to manage the ongoing war. The [Root.GetPrimaryTribe], known for their fierce warriors, clamored for an aggressive, offensive strategy, believing that seizing the initiative would secure victory swiftly. In contrast, the [Root.GetSecondaryTribe], renowned for their diplomatic finesse, argued for a more cautious, diplomatic route, advocating for negotiations and alliances with neighboring nations to avoid further bloodshed. Tensions escalated as each faction staunchly defended their stance, threatening to fracture the unity of the Confederation just when it was needed most on the battlefield. The stakes were high, and the decision they made would determine not only the course of the war but the very future of the Confederation itself."
pf_trn.4.a: "The [Root.GetPrimaryTribe]'s plan seems promising..."
pf_trn.4.b: "... but I like the ideas of the [Root.GetSecondaryTribe] better."
pf_trn.4.c: "The Council will decide its own course in war!"
pf_trn.4.dd: "There is no time for fighting amongst ourselves, there is glory to be won!"

pf_trn.5.t: "The Disgraced Chief"
pf_trn.5.d: "In a solemn gathering of the Council of Elders, the chief of one of the Confederation's tribes faced a grave judgment. Accused of betraying the trust of the alliance by forging secret alliances with an enemy faction, the chief was found guilty after hours of deliberation. The room, heavy with tension, echoed with the weight of the verdict. The elders' decision, delivered with a heavy heart, stripped the chief of leadership and cast a shadow over the once-respected figure. It was a somber reminder that even the most powerful must answer for their actions, and the Confederation's unity stood above individual ambition."
pf_trn.5.a: "Respect the decision of the Council."
pf_trn.5.b: "This man was wrongfully convicted!"
pf_trn.5.c: "We will make sure he has a plentiful retirement."

pf_trn.6.t: "Searching the Stars"
pf_trn.6.d: "The court of the Confederacy beckoned the skilled astrologer to its grand observatory, seeking his wisdom and foresight among the celestial tapestry. With eyes fixed upon the heavens, the astrologer meticulously charted the movements of stars and planets. He delved into the ancient scrolls, seeking patterns and deciphering cryptic alignments that might unveil the kingdom's destiny. The weight of high expectations hung heavy as he scanned the cosmos for portents, searching for answers in the distant constellations, hoping to reveal prophecies hidden among the celestial wonders above."
pf_trn.6.a: "What secrets do the heavens hold?"
pf_trn_searching_the_stars_tt: "The astrologer will search the skies for omens for the next year."

pf_trn.7.t: "Good Omens"
pf_trn.7.d: "After a year of studying the stars for omens about the future of the Confederation, our astrologer has reported back to the Council with his findings. He says he observed various remarkable celestial events, including astounding planetary alignments and stars that grow and shrink in brightness. From this evidence has come up with a conclusion - there are good omens from above. The heavens predict power will come to the Confederation to the detriment of our enemies, bringing about a new era of hope and glory for all Britons."
pf_trn.7.a: "What marvellous news!"

pf_trn.8.t: "A Man of Other Worlds"
pf_trn.8.d: "Ricatus was the chief of the Trinovantes, given power at a young age at the death of his uncle. After years of successfuly policies in his locality, the Council of Elders deisgnated him to govern over the whole Confederation. He was best known for his well-mannered speech and considerate tone, always soothing the anxieties of our enemies even in the most dire situations. Using these skills, he took a diplomatic approach to foreign policy, securing a surprising peace with the Lords of Celtica and even with the marauding Northmen. Many did not approve of this peaceful approach however, leading to increasing accusations of weakness and even a common theory that Ricatus was deluded and living in another world. Despite these fears, his reign did not lead to the collapse of the Confederation, and in fact it rather strengthened the country, leaving it in a favourable political and economic position.\nHis death has been a great blow to our nation. To commemorate his extraordinary life a great funeral has been arranged, complete with all the usual rituals and games of Druidic practice."
pf_trn.8.a: "Invite the nations that most benefited from his truce."
pf_trn.8.b: "Give him a warrior's funeral in Brittonic style."

pf_trn.9.t: "The Death of Ricatus 'the Shield'"
pf_trn.9.d: "Ricatus was one of the most respectable chiefs of the Brittonic Confederation we have ever dealt with. His conciliatory and cowering approach to our people was greatly effective for us, allowing us to squeeze what we wanted out of the region without the boring spectacle of war. But alas, he is dead, and our security is no more. It appears that his successors in the Confederation are pursuing a more aggressive foreign policy, and are perhaps even plotting for war with [Root.GetName]!\n\nIn his memory, a grand funeral complete with games and rituals is being held, and in their grace, the Council of Elders has issued an invite to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of [Root.GetName] as well. How should we respond?"
pf_trn.9.a: "Attend the funeral."
pf_trn.9.b: "We are glad he is dead!"

pf_trn.10.t: "Assistance from the Druids"
pf_trn.10.d: "With our willingness to give them what they want proven, the Druids of the realm have come together and elected representatives to meet with the Council. Anxious to keep their new privileges and lands, they may be willing to offer their support in the upcoming war with the down-trodden subject Britons. In what area do we require the most assistance?"
pf_trn.10.a: "Request their assistance in rallying the people for war."
pf_trn.10.b: "Let them serve in the administration to ease the burden of war."
pf_trn.10.c: "They should focus on the spiritual conflict fought simultaneously."
pf_trn.10.dd: "I do not need their help."

pf_trn.11.t: "The Celtic Tyranny"
pf_trn.11.d: "Long ago, the peoples of Albion lived in harmony. Wars and petty tribal conflicts had plagued the island for centuries, but peace had at last arrived on its sightly golden chariot. Old grudges were set aside, and agreement of mutual defence were made. Peoples who had for centuries lived in competition with one another now lived in bliss.\n\nEverything changed when the Gaels attacked. They entered these isles just like their ancestors did - accompanied by hoards of bowmen and savage thugs. This time, however, they had not come just to raid - they had come to conquer. The tribes of Celtica had been united by force only a few years prior, creating a new power in the region with resources and warriors in amounts no other tribe had seen before. They turned this new war machine against our fair island, and laid siege to its extremeties.\n\nThe peoples of the north stood no chance - too busy with their own squabbling, the Pictish tribes fell one by one. The people of north and south Cymry too, divided they fell. In the east, where the most ancient of the tribes of the Celtic Isles dwelt, that peaceful orchard among a flaming forest, they felt the harded resistance. Despite the best efforts of the alliances of bold and mighty kings and their druids, much of Albion was placed under the boot of Celtica and set ablaze. Facing certain doom otherwise, the tribes of the far east, known to history as the Oaken Five, formed a confederation between their leaderships, and placed their combined armies at the whim of a joint Council of Elders. They successfully mounted a defence of the frontiers along the Thames river, and scored a decisive victory at the battle of Camulodunon, forcing the Gaelic dragon out of Confederate lands.\n\nIn the years since this victory, the Confederation has prospered through mutual cooperation and the sharing of resources, maintaining its independence even as the new threat of Nordic invaders loomed on the horizon. In contrast, the subjugated Britons, now forced to pay yearly tribute to the Lord of Celtica, wallowed in their misery with each passing season. Their wifes were taken, their leaders executed, and now even their harvests were not fully theirs. While at night they dreamed of independence, by day the served like a faithful hound before its master. The Confederation is the last hope for these down-trodden people. By force of might, we must overthrow this Celtic Tyranny and liberate our brothers and sisters!"
pf_trn.11.a: "Now we just need a plan!"
pf_trn_celtic_tyranny_tt: "The ambitions of the younger chiefs grow, while the elders still play their games of truces and diplomacy..."

pf_trn.12.t: "Like Mother, Like Daughter"
pf_trn.12.d: "The Daughters of Boudicca have performed well for us on the battlefield, scoring many key victories and greatly assisting our efforts to put down rebellions. For their service, they have been rewarded handsomely with shares of the war booty and extra payment upon their return to their villages. Such is the extent of their success, however, that many in our military establishment long for them to be a formal part of the growing Confederate Army. We could then use their skills whenever we need, and at potentially much lower prices. On the other hand, there are many, particularly amongst the Daughters themselves, that they should retain their independence, running through the wilds with sword in hand beholden to know government without a contract. What will be their future?"
pf_trn.12.a: "Integrate them into our standing army."
pf_trn.12.b: "Let the Daughters retain their freedom."

pf_trn_integrate_daughters_of_boudicca: "The Daughters of Boudicca Regiment"

pf_trn.13.t: "The Magic of the Druids"
pf_trn.13.d: "The druids have always been associated with magic and mystic actions. From their earliest days, they were said to be able to cast spells that would create a 'fence of protection' around armies, raise ferocious storms to hinder invading armies, and predict the future with remarkable accuracy. Most of these powers are now thought to be little more than myths created by our excited ancestors. While the druids certainly have profound influence with the gods and nature, they are no more wizards than the rest of us. A few old folk hang on to these beliefs however, and swear they saw their long dead relatives practices benign magic. This is clearly nothing but baseless superstition, but there is a certain part of the mind of every one of us that wants it to be true..."
pf_trn.13.a: "We must look to the future, not to the past."

pf_trn.14.t: "The Thirteen Treasures of Albion"
pf_trn.14.d: "Legends tell of a collection of artefacts known as the 'Thirteen Treasures of Albion'. The objects are the subjects of many myths, and are encountered in a vast array of tales about great heroes of old from across the Brittonic world. Several notable items include the Hamper of Gwyddno Garanhir, which when food was placed within it, would return it a hundred-fold; the Whetstone of Tudwal Tudglyd, which when a brave man sharpened his sword on it, would guarantee the death of any man cut by that sword; and the Mantle of Arthur, which would grant invisibility to those under it, while still being able to see normally themselves. Whether or not these treasures are real is debatable, but they are certainly an important part of our cultural history. Without the shrewd work of poets and bards, these stories would be lost to time."

Extreme cold and snowfall slows down marches and severely hampers the troops' fighting ability, often leaving us vulernable to ambushes and attacks by local tribes more familiar with the terrain. A new practice of introducing thick black fur coats is beginning, and officers are readily adopting it across the field. These new 'blackcoated' men and women are tougher and able to withstand the harsh environment."
pf_trn.15.a: "Distribute the black coats more widely."
pf_trn.15.b: "Let them freeze!"

pf_trn.16.t: "The Black Terror"
pf_trn.16.d: "The Blackcoats have grown used to their success and fame. When they march through a village and are greeted with the usual cheers and claps, it no longer brings joy to their faces. They have become desensitised to the way life is for normal people. As a result, they are acting increasingly violent and launching citizens over minor provocations, completely against the rules of our army and our country."
pf_trn.16.a: "We cannot hope to control them."
pf_trn.16.b: "Punish the perpetrators."

pf_trn.17.t: "The Legacy of Old King Coel"
pf_trn.17.d: "King Coel was a legendary Brittonic figure who ruled much of the north of Albion from his stronghold in Eburacum. His empire was the greatest yet seen from the northern reaches, only succeeded by the Iceni Empire of Boudicca. We now control much the same borders as the great king, and also his capital fortress. In order to legitimise our claim to the region, we have taken on the mantle of 'Successors to King Coel', 'Meibion y Coel Hen'."
pf_trn.17.a: "His was truly a realm of the Old North."
pf_trn.17.b: "No one shall question our conquests now."
pf_trn_kingdom_of_coel_hen: "Claimed the Kingdom of Coel Hen"
desc_pf_trn_kingdom_of_coel_hen: "Coel Hen was an ancient king of northern Albion who ruled a diverse region from Pictland to Elmet. With our conquest of the same region, we have taken up the mantle of his true successors."

pf_trn.18.t: "Supremacy of the Trinovantes"
pf_trn.18.d: "The Trinovantes tribe were the most powerful of the Oaken Five when the Confederation was first formed. It was their chief Bronwen that proposed the alliance against Celtic incursion in the first place. As a result, the Trinovantes have always held a privileged position compared to the other tribes, with even their capital of Camulodonon serving as the seat of the Council of Elders. Times have changed since the foundation of the Confederation however, and some of the other tribes have grown more powerful at the expense of the Trinovantes, leaving many of them to question why their tribe is not elevated to the same extent. How shall we address this situation?"
pf_trn.18.a: "Every tribe in the Confederation is equal."
pf_trn.18.b: "The Trinovantes' leadership brings stability to the country."
pf_trn_sup_tri_1: "Equal Confederation"
pf_trn_sup_tri_2: "Exclusive Confederation"

pf_trn.19.t: "Wrath of the Blackcoats"
pf_trn.19.d: "The Blackcoats began as simply a program to ensure our army was tough enough to survive the sometimes brutal weather of Albion, but they have rapidly evolved into a self-sufficient and extremely arrogant military unit. Acting practically as mercenaries and vigilantes, they are using the skills they homed in our army against every day people and causing chaos across the country. Many disaffected Blackcoats essentially rule desolate areas of the countryside as warlords, reigning over their unwilling subjects with terror and torture.\n\nThe problem of the Blackcoats has been at the front of the mind of politicians for a long time, but no one has the gaul to do anything to seriously weaken their power, lest they provoke their wrath. One group stood defiant however - the Daughters of Boudicca. Themselves a mercenary group, the Daughters have done nothing but actively voice their concerns about the Blackcoats in the years since their founding, much to the distaste of the latter. Before now, their competition had been lobbying within the government and particularly stressful card games, but now things have stepped up into a national crisis.\n\nA rogue band of Blackcoats, apparently acting on the orders of the officer of the whole regiment, broke into the barracks of the Daughters of Boudicca and committed a massacre. By the time local police forces arrived, it was too late. Every single one of the Daughters had been slaughted, most of them while they slept. Some three hundred bodies had to be cleared from the building before a proper investigation could begin, some of them slain in the most savage manners imaginable. The Blackcoats have openly claimed responsibility and now gloat of their supremacy within the army, their only real opposition now removed. The world leans in to listen to the chaos unfolding. Many in the government believe we are but months away from a full on military coup, and demand that action be taken against the Blackcoats now before it is too late."
pf_trn.19.a: "The Blackcoats are fugitives from justice! Hunt them down and let them hang!"
pf_trn.19.b: "They have done the world a favour by killing the Daughters."

pf_trn_supported_the_blackcoats: "Supporting the Blackcoats"

pf_trn.20.t: "The Unification of Albion"
pf_trn.20.d: "Albion is the name given to the largest island of the Celtic Isles, the one we and countless other peoples call home. Our conquests have brought our armies to the corners of this rich and cultured land, and extended the rule of the [Root.GetName] beyond what our ancestors had previously dreamed was possible. Albion, that great country, is now ruled by one state. At last, our children can rejoice, knowing that they live in a safe and cohesive part of the world, free from open tribal feuds and petty disputes. Instead, they live in a veritable paradise - but unlike that which is told in our myths, this paradise is very much accessable."
pf_trn.20.a: "This is not a common union, it is a Celtic one!"
pf_trn.20.b: "Rejoice! The dream is realised!"

pf_trn.21.t: "The Black Comet"
pf_trn.21.d: "In the last few weeks an omen has appeared in the sky - a great comet, its trail blazing across perhaps a fifth of the sky, passed by the world. Comets have always been extremely important to our people, interested in astrology and omens as we are, but this one seems to have reached the thoughts of every soul. Such is its beauty and detail, everyone is convinced it has been sent for a reason. Surely such a magnificent comet is an indicator of something equally as magnificent to come, or to some minds, something terribly destructive. While the country is engulfed in civil war against the Blackcoats, all have managed to put down their weapons and stare in awe at the sky, each person giving the sight their own meaning. Many Blackcoats have seen this as an prophecy predicting their victory, and have begun hailing it as the so-called 'Black Comet'. Whether this is true or not remains to be seen, but what is known for certain is that it is a truly a splendid sight to behold."
pf_trn.21.a: "Whatever it means, it will surely shape our future for years to come!"

pf_trn.22.t: "Losing Control"
pf_trn.22.d: "The fighting ongoing over the soul of the nation has resulted in local authority in many parts declining, including in [pf_autonomous_province.GetName]. The remote villages in this region are effectively self governing now, and a band of armed men has been set up to act as a defense against government and rebel alike."
pf_trn.22.a: "We will show them!"

pf_trn.23.t: "The Blackcoats March on [Root.Capital.GetName]"
pf_trn.23.d: "As their strength grows, the Blackcoats are becoming ever more ambitious with their aims. We have received reports that they are planning to unite their forces and march on [Root.Capital.GetName], with the aim of outright overthrowing our government and establishing our own. Never in our worst nightmares could we have dreamed up such a disasterous scenario."
pf_trn.23.a: "Man the walls! We fight to the last soul!"
pf_trn.23.b: "The Blackcoats are right! Down with the old government!"
pf_trn_a_spirited_defence: "A Spirited Defence"

pf_trn.24.t: "The Elders Meet their End"
pf_trn.24.d: "The Council of Elders has been the formal government of the country for centuries, and it is to them that we owe our current position. However, they also represent the vestiges of oppression and irritation the Blackcoats have risen up against, and thus it has been determined that they had to die. In one day, the Blackcoats cut their way into the Council Chamber and proceeded to disembowl every man and woman inside, hanging their entrails from the gates and piling the bodies out for all citizens to see. Chaos has gripped the streets of the capital, as now it seems the whole government has collapsed."
pf_trn.24.a: "My city is unsafe - I must flee into exile!"
pf_trn.24.b: "We can trust the Blackcoats to restore order."

pf_trn.25.t: "The Counter-Revolution"
pf_trn.25.d: "The Blackcoat state has proven remarkably unstable and inefficient in even the most basic tenets of government. At last, even its grip over its own generals has faltered, and the very system of justice and policing has disintegrated. In response, the counter-revolutionary movements that had previously been forced underground in the wake of the Blackcoat Revolution, led by the enterprising League of Free Britons, have staged a general uprising. In a matter of hours they seized key positions across the country, clearly reflecting a great deal of foreplanning. Now, their victory seems inevitable, and Blackcoat after Blackcoat are deserting their posts in an attempt to save their lives."
pf_trn.25.a: "The new Revolution is victorious!"
pf_trn.25.b: "We will fight to the last Blackcoat!"
pf_trn_the_counter_revolution_restores_peace: "The Counter-Revolution Restores Peace"
blackcoat_zeal_end_tt: "§RThe new Regime will suffer a Counter-Revolution.§!"

pf_trn.26.t: "The End of the Revolution"
pf_trn.26.d1: "At last, Blackcoat forces reign triumphant over [Root.GetName]. Their rule may not be as benevolent as the previous regime, but it will certainly ensure a calibre of military quality and discipline unseen in previous ages. While the last remnants of citizen's resistance is being mopped up, the new government begins to settle in to its position of supreme power."
pf_trn.26.d2: "At last, the rebellious Blackcoat forces have been defeated, and the central government has firmly re-established its control over the country. Many lay dead, and whole regions are devastated from the fierce fighting, but the sound of gunfire and swords clashing is becoming increasingly rare. This has been a nightmare for all involved, and will surely raise a great many questions about the way this country is run and the position of its military."
pf_trn.26.a: "It is over."

pf_trn.27.t: "[Root.GetPrimaryTribe] Rallies for War"
pf_trn.27.d: "Despite the current state of peace with our neighbours, one of the tribes of the Confederation has been crying out desperately for war. The constant marching of their warriors and target practice has annoyed the people of [Root.GetSecondaryTribe], who have issued a formal complaint to the Council of Elders. Which tribe should we favour?"
pf_trn.27.a: "Allow the [Root.GetPrimaryTribe] to train their troops."
pf_trn.27.b: "Favour the [Root.GetSecondaryTribe] point of view."
pf_trn.27.c: "Surely we can come to some kind of arrangement?"

By our times his name is little more than a legend, but a powerful one at that. We are now in control of much the same territory Coel managed in his heyday. Perhaps it would be appropriate to crown ourselves his true successors?"

Spurred on by the mistreatment of her and her daughters by the invasive Trinovantes after the death of her husband, Boudicca led a campaign of conquest and revenge that took her across Albion, establishing Iceni dominion where ever she went. While her empire collapsed quickly after her death, the tales of her deeds are yet to die - many generations of Iceni warriors have looked to her as the guiding hand behind their victories, with some even offering sacrifices to appease her still-living spirit. A group of women, who would traditionally have been reserved for domestic life, known as the 'Daughters of Boudicca', claim to be her descendants, and continue to practice her battle techniques and preach of her righteous conquest.
